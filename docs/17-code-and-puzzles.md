# Unit Overview

# Lessig Chapter 1

<div class="discussion">

There will be lots of opportunity for me to guide us through Lessig work and his major conclusions. So rather than simply summarize chapter 1, I'd like to ask you to see what you take away from this opening chapter

<span class="respond"/> What is Lessig's thesis for this book? What is the main thing he wants his reader to take away?

As you respond, try to use textual evidence (citing pages and passages) to document and support the responses you come up with.

# Lessig Chapter 2: Four Puzzles From Cyberspace

Chapter 2 is a great start as it provides no answers, but instead tries to introduce puzzles. 

These are **puzzles** that emerge through combination of familiar human activity channeled through new communications medium. THe new medium does not leave the action unaffected. It changes the action and creates new problem. 

This is puzzling because on the one hand the action is familiar. But on the other hand the consequences and effects of that action are unfamiliar. 

This create puzzles about what to do. Do we need to accept the new consequences even if they feel unpleasant or outrageous? Or do we need to modify and restrict behavior, even though this same behavior once seemed fine and innocent? 

So in each these examples I want to look for the following three structures: 1) common human action, 2) new medium, 3) uncommon consequences. 

## Example 1: MMOG

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
<span class="respond"/> What's common about the activity undertaken in this space?
<span class="respond"/> How is the common activity taking place in a new form?
<span class="respond"/> What are some of the uncommon consequences that result?
</div>

## Example 2: Gambling across state lines

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
<span class="respond"/> What's common about the activity undertaken in this space?
<span class="respond"/> How is the common activity taking place in a new form?
<span class="respond"/> What are some of the uncommon consequences that result?
</div>

## Example 3: Jake the author on USENET

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
<span class="respond"/> What's common about the activity undertaken in this space?
<span class="respond"/> How is the common activity taking place in a new form?
<span class="respond"/> What are some of the uncommon consequences that result?
</div>

## Example 4: Worms that sniff

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
<span class="respond"/> What's common about the activity undertaken in this space?
<span class="respond"/> How is the common activity taking place in a new form?
<span class="respond"/> What are some of the uncommon consequences that result?
</div>

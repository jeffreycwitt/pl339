# Course Feedback

Use this page as a general place to offer any course feedback. 

Use our class annotation tool to make a "page" annotation and leave any feedback you want. If something is not working, leave a comment. If something could work better, leave a comment. If something is working well, and you want to do more, leave a comment. 

When leaving a comment also use the tag "feedback" so that we can group together all feedback comments. This means you not only can leave feedback here, **but you can leave a "feedback" comment on any page**. Just use the "feedback" and they will be grouped together with all other feedback comments and be available here.

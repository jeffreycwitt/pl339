title: "Annotation Participation Expectations and Rubric"

# General Grading Methodology

The use of the "hypothesis" annotation tool fits our course aims extremely well. Not only is at vehicle for asynchronous discussion (particularly needed during our strange remote interaction semester), but the tool itself inspired the pioneers of the Internet and thinkers who imagined the possibilities of networked discussions that could escape the confines of print. 

Thus, the successful use of this tool by the entire class would mean a vibrant networked back and forth discussion by all members of the class. 

Ideally, this success would not be measured by quantities of annotations or word counts, but by the quality, sincerity, and enthusiasm of interaction. The discussion will become most vibrant, when participants "lean into" the activity, get excited by the way we can network discussions together, and begin to take the initiative to connect conversations and pull in content from across the web.

The challenge of course is that "ideal participation" can be realized in lots of way and I want students to be creative and inventive about the ways that they participate. 

Nevertheless, I know that people will want some ground rules and metrics so that they can measure their participation and make sure they are living up to class expectations. 

Therefore, below is a list of "meet expectations" participation. Meeting the expectations outlined will result in 85 or B for this participation part of our course. A participation grade will be marked at the end of each of our 3 units. 

A score of 88 (B+) 90 (A-) or 93 (A) will be reserved for people whose participation tends toward "ideal participation". That is, they meet the expectations outline here, but also take the initiative to introduce new information or related articles, connect related posts, add replies to other students annotations, use tags or suggest new tags, provide reflective feedback on what is working and not working and how we could do better.

#  Expectations and Going Beyond Expectations

**Discussion Blocks**: Generally, there will be at least one discussion block per course packet lesson. Meeting expectations means that students will respond to at least one discussion block per course lesson. Your response/annotaiton should be "substantive, interesting, and relevant".

Going beyond expectations here might mean, in addition to providing your own response, responding to the annotations of others, creating links between related annotations, suggesting relevant tags to link discussions together, and generally enhancing the discussion.

**Glossary**: I would like each student to take responsibility for one "glossary" entry annotation per unit. This means finding a word that appears in our course packet or reading, tagging it as "glossary" and then providing and extended annotation that defines the word, explains its importance, and makes connections to other resources. You don't have to do this all at once. You can work on and re-edit this annotation over the course of the unit. If someone has already created a glossary entry for your desired word, I ask that you choose another word.

Going beyond expectations here might include using the "gc" tag (glossary candidate) to identify technical words throughout our readings that would be good candidates for a glossary entry, by you or someone else in the class; it might also mean responding to other people's glossary entries, either making further connections or suggesting ways that can improve or enhance the entry.

**Needs Discussion**: Since one part of the goal of our asynchronous discussion is to prepare for our live Zoom discussions, I ask that for each upcoming class you mark something in our readings that you think is important but want to follow up on during our class discussion. We can use the "nd" ("needs discussion") tag for this, indicating that the issue needs clarification or further discussion. This annotation could be applied to the course packet lesson or to any of the "annotatable PDFs". This annotation should explain why the target is of interest, what is puzzling you about it, and what kind of clarification or further discussion is needed.

Going beyond expectations here might include making several "nd" annotations or it might mean recognizing and identifying common themes among multiple "nd" annotations made by several students in the lead up to a course discussion. 

Beyond these annotations, any and all types of annotations are encouraged. People going beyond expectations will actively annotate things of interest, explain why they are of interest to our class material, and/or reply to the annotations of others.

Again, the above expectations are not meant to quantify or restrict participation, but to give an idea of the ground floor. I'm most excited to see the multiple and varied kinds of participation that will emerge organically if we "lean in" as enthusiastic and active participants.

**Note** I understand this is a new way of doing things, with lots of open ended possibilities. That's part of what makes it exciting. But it also means that sometimes things won't work well and we will need to revise things. I will be flexible and patient with you just as I hope you will be flexible and patient with me. As part of our reflection on the way media shapes consciousness, we will reflect together on what is and isn't working, and why. And we will of course make adjustments as we go.

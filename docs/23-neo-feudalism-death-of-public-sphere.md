# Review: 

# What is the Public Sphere?

{:.rquestion} 
How Does Louw describe the public sphere? p. 93-96

{:.rquestion} 
Why is dialectic Critical to the Frankfurt School and Habermas's idea of the public sphere?

Louw, p. 95: "The 'mechanism' of dialectical conflict lay at the hart of Frankfurt School thinking."

# Concerns over Commercialization in the 1980's

What is Garnham concerned about the loss of PSB (Public Service Broadcasting)

See Louw, introductary section

FCC auctions rather than licenses bandwidth. (See Lessig)

Media conglomerates own much or all of bandwidth space.

# Habermas, Commercialization and Neo-Feudalism

{:.rquestion} 
Why does this commercialization destroy the public sphere and create neo-feudalism?

In short, commercialization has interest in preventing dialectic. 

If the original bourgeosie class was the antitheis, they have no become the "thesis" and they have interest in preserving the status quo. (see p. 96)

> p. 96: "Following Adorno and Horkheimer's lead, the Frankfurt School argued that the culture industry was inherently undialectical and one-dimensional, producing 'mass culture' made by an elite group of professional communicators" 

{:.rquestion} 
How did/is the new ruling class modifying the communications landscape to make dialectic more difficult? 

> Louw, p. 97

{:.rquestion}  Why is it not obvious that the public sphere is lost? Why does it seem like there is still is a public sphere, why does Habermas call this is a pseudo public sphere?

20th century gave rise of "professional communicators" (public relations) whose goal was to construct the idea of "public opinion" as in support of the aims of private interest, as way of generating mass support for private aims. 

> p. 94: "over time, the public sphere enmeshed with 'representivity' and managerialism, becoming merely a means to legitimate managerialists ruling elites. Habermas bemoaned the resulting 'pseudo' democracy which he said, effectively constituted a 'depoliticized public realm' (Habermass 1976:37) Hence, by the late twentieth century, although there was the appearance of political participation in Western democracies, the effects of offering voters 'pseudo' choices meant that politicians faced increasingly cynical electorates..."

see p. 97: "So mass culture results from top-down, planned communication geared towards producing 'distracting', no dialogical communication"

"The Frankfurt School, using Frudian notions, argued that mass culture was a form of reverse psychoanalysis."

See p. 98

There is a possible objection: Might the expansion of cable programming be a remedy to this, and allow for the possibility of multiple voices, and genuine dialectic?

{:.rquestion} 
Why does Louw suggest this is NOT what is happening? p. 99

{:.answer}
Private interests are still controlling the diversification. It is the simulation of niche difference still controlled by monolithic private interest. p. 99 following

{:.rquestion} 
Where doe Louw (and Enzensberger) see real possibility for "dialectic" to re-emerge?

> p. 103: "Global information capitalists will be compelled to continually expand the world's digital communication networks. The sheer size of the network makes it too large to control or to monitor or limit its uses fully. So just as the old bourgeois revolutionary 'public sphere' grew out of the Gutenberg print revolution, **so too may new 'human interactivities' grow as a by-product of using the (as yet unimagined) possibilities inherent in the evolving digital networks**"

(This is a great transition to next class, where will look at Shapiro and the political excitement caused by the emerging digital media.)


# Example: Gary Web and the Dark Alliance Article

The Gary Webb saga was recently made into a Hollywood movie. Let's get a sense of the story from the trailer.

<div class="video">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VW4XO-52ubE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>

A key dynamic in this story, in connection to the concerns about "Neo-Feudalism" raised by Habermas is who Gary Web worked for and how his story was effectively silenced. 

Gary Web worked for a small market regional newspaper, **The San Jose Mercury**. This very small paper did not have a national readerships, did not have a lot of money, and thus did not have the financial backing to defend a highly controversial story against critique, whether justified or not.

Also relevant to our concern, is where the loudest critique of Webb's story was coming from. Webb notes that the CIA remained largely silent to his reporting. Instead his story was heavily critiqued and dismissed by other newspapers. But not newspapers like his, "Mass Media" newspapers, backed by millions of dollars, controlled by elite power brokers. 

The Huffington Post's Ryan Grim provides a kind of summary article of the role of mass media in discrediting the story of Gary Web in an article title [Kill The Messenger: How The Media Destroyed Gary Webb](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kill-the-messenger_n_5962708)

The article focuses on the Washington Post in particular and suggest that its close association with the power brokers of Washington incentivized the paper taking a critical and dismissive stance toward Webb's article. 

Grim captures this in the words of Douglas Farah, a former reporter for the Washington Post:

> The same would not hold true of most of Farah’s colleagues, either in the newspaper business in general or at the Post in particular. “If you’re talking about our intelligence community tolerating — if not promoting — drugs to pay for black ops, it’s rather an uncomfortable thing to do when you’re **an establishment paper** like the Post,” Farah told me. **“If you were going to be directly rubbing up against the government, they wanted it more solid than it could probably ever be done.”** <span class="citation" data-reading="32BHTJTJ" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/I9jC7CjaEeuVTeOm6E4eyw/www.huffpost.com/entry/kill-the-messenger_n_5962708"/> 

{:.rquestion}
Why might the Post be hesitant to too overtly criticize the government? How might this effect their long term success as a newspaper?

Grim continues: 

> "Farah, now a consultant on the drug trade with the Department of Homeland Security, speculated that the Post’s proximity to the corridors of power made it beholden to whatever the official line was at the time." <span class="citation" data-reading="32BHTJTJ" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/r-ONYijVEeu2Uluy5hVahg/www.huffpost.com/entry/kill-the-messenger_n_5962708"/> 

As Habermas noted this kind of influence is a big concern from the health of society truly governed by the will of the people. Recall: 

![picture](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/HabermasPublicSphereFigures/Folie1.jpeg)

In this image, we can see the danger. Habermas worries that the "administrative power", while seemingly constrained by the pool of "normative reasons" it has to justify its action, it can bypass this constraint if it is able to manipulate the deliberative/communications process that generates this "normative reasons".


Other journalists, like Beverly Bandler from Consortiumnews, have likewise seen Gary Webb Saga as power example the power of Mass Media to determine what does or does not get discussed in the public sphere.

> "2) The concerted effort by U.S. major news media, specifically, the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Washington Post to not only disparage the scandal but also discredit investigative reporter Gary Webb who, in 1996,  revived the story by explaining the Contra cocaine’s impact on U.S. cities in the 1980s."
<span class="citation" data-reading="5SZGHU55" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/uNQHWijYEeuxUM_rum1KRA/consortiumnews.com/2014/11/02/gary-webb-and-media-manipulation/">

Gary Web's editor Dan Simon summarizes the saga as follows: 

> “The mainstream print media was ominously silent until October and November 1996,” Simon continued, “when The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times all finally picked up the story. But instead of launching their own investigations into whether the CIA had shielded drug traffickers, these papers went after Gary’s reporting, although they ‘could not find a single significant factual error,’ as Gary’s then-editor at The Mercury News, Jerry Ceppos, would write in an internal memo.
“But after that, the series was described frequently as ‘discredited.’ Soon the story and Gary himself were spoiled goods. Gary’s editor switched sides and penned an apologia distancing the paper from the series. Gary was forced out of his job, even though the body of evidence supporting Gary’s account was actually growing. Two years later, the CIA’s internal investigation would prove to be a vindication of Gary’s work.” <span class="citation" data-reading="5SZGHU55" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/AYyIZCjZEeuVEB94MLn-Wg/consortiumnews.com/2014/11/02/gary-webb-and-media-manipulation/">

Note a particular insidious problem here: even to the tell the story of the Gary Webb Saga one has to rely on sources. Sources like "consortiunews" or even the Huffington Post -- that see the story as an example of the power of mass media to silence independent news reporting -- are themselves typically also niche publications -- whereas major outlets like tend to be silent. (This makes sense sense: if the point here is that major news outlets, one can rarely expect that these outlets will be eager to critque themselves.) But this creates a serious confidence problem for the general public. The more imbalance that exists between small market and mass market, the more vicious this confidence problem becomes, making the conditions of a "rationalized life-world" or the conditions for a healthy public sphere more and more difficult)

In any case, it is fitting, in the end, if we can hear from Gary Webb himself. 

(This video is also important because it helps to transition to our theme for our next meeting. Namely, Web, at the end of the video, praises the Internet as vehicle to bring stories to light, that otherwise could not reach a national audience becomes of costs of national publication and the control of the national market by a few powerful conglomerates.)

# Notes

Vietnam war might be good example of how government tries to control narrative of what is happening. Real details were reported by rogue reports / news outlets [i would need article here]

Another example is that movie (starring Jeremy Renner) about the San Jose reporter trying to do a story about CIA in south america and how is story was marginalized and discredited by major news outlets that were pressured by government to smother it.

These examples suggest the impact and influcence of media forms on the possibility of a genuine public sphere. Many like Habermas worry that a public sphere is no longer possibile precisely because the medium no longer allows a genuine area for a diversity of opinion where a genuine debate can occur. -->



<!-- This attitude can be seen Grim quotes the Washinton Post publisher Katharine Graham: 

> “We live in a dirty and dangerous world,” Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham told a gathering of CIA recruits in 1988. “There are some things the general public does not need to know, and shouldn’t. I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows.” 
Webb apparently made the wrong decision, and Graham’s paper was instrumental in his story’s discrediting. On Oct. 2, after “Dark Alliance” had gained some traction on black radio and online, renowned [former] Post media reporter Howard Kurtz weighed in, heading off the most damning of the piece’s implications. <span class="citation" data-reading="32BHTJTJ" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/2Fp_rijUEeudBC91R9LeRQ/www.huffpost.com/entry/kill-the-messenger_n_5962708"/>  -->

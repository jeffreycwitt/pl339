# Review

In the past couple of weeks, we've attempted to trace a kind of trajectory beginning with Kant and the Enlightenment. 

The idea was that with Rousseau, Kant and others, I knew idea of governance was emerging, whereby the people governed themselves. 

For this not to result in Chaos Rousseau had to make a distinction between our private wills (our immediate inclinations) and our real selves represented by the General Will. 

The goal was for a society govererned, not by everyone's competing whims, but by their true autonomous selves, even if they were not yet capable of knowing their own "real will". 

If the self can be divided in this way, political theorists were eager to find mechanisms that would allow the "real will" to be filtered from the capricious whims of our knee-jerk reactions. 

What was wanted was wanted was not "Direct Democracy" but "Deliberative Democracy". For this a kind of "filtering mechanism" was needed

Kant's idea was that this filtering could occur if a society allowed everyone the free use of their public reason, while they obediently continued to carry out their civic responsibilities. 

The "free of public reason" thus assumes communication possibilities and media forms that support this. 

Again, it does not good to say, everyone is free talk, when there is no language. Theoretically no one is stopping you from talking, but if the medium to communicate does not exist, then this theoretical freedom is practically useless. 

It is not suprising then, that in Habermas's history of the public sphere, the birth of the enlightenment coincides with a unique type of communications environment that thrived in late 18 and early 19th century. 

We've already talk about a bit about these media forms and the ways in which the "archicture" and "code" of these media forms contributes to the goals of "deliberation" (e.g. newspapers and letters are fast, but not too fast)

But we've also seen that Habermas and Louw see in the middle of the 20th century decisive changes to the communications landscape that are no longer compatible with the idea of a public sphere and deliberative democracy. And thus Habermas speaks of a "Neo-Feudalism" and Louw speaks of the "death of the public Sphere."

It is with this in mind that I want to turn, again moving historically, to why people saw the Internet as a such a beacon of hope for democracy; just as the media shifts of the 20th century threatened the possibility of the public sphere, these enthusiasts saw the next media shift (to the internet) and a possible savior of deliberative democracy.

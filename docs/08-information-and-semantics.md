# Review

We've spent some time now thinking about what information is as a kind of abstract "medium" that allows communication across what we're previously seen as incompatible communication channels. 

We've spent a little time last week thinking about this abstraction allows from a common language to approach problems in what are seemingly diverse fields, for example, psychology, physics, biology.

What made this possible of course the kind of abstraction performed by Shannon. His ability to identify and quantify information as something identifiable distinct from the meaning transmitted via this information was what made this kind of universalizing process possible. 

# New questions for the field of Philosophy of Information

But it has raised new questions for the still emerging field of Philosophy of Information and related fields like the Philosophy of Language and Philosophy of Mind

The central problem or question lingering for philosopher working in this field is: if information is something divorced from meaning (or "semantics"), how is that human beings, as receivers at the end of the communication channel receive not just information, but meaning.

These receivers are referred to in our reading "semantically enabled agents". 

Again, one of the features of Shannon's new idea of information is that because it abstracted away from semantics it allowed us to see communication as something that ocurred without "semantically enabled agents" and thereby allowing us to see many seemingly diverse problems as all instances of a common problem of communication.

Our reading captures this fairly well when its says: 

> However, we also observe that the use of the word “information” is not confined to such cases involving semantically enabled senders and receivers of messages. For example, we speak of information being transferred when referring to the exchange of data between fax machines, or between clients and servers 
that transmit data by means of internet protocols. In both cases, the machines involved do not understand the information in the way we do. Moreover, we use the word “information” even for systems that are not constructed by human engineers, like the transfer of genetic information between chromosomes of the cell nucleus and the ribosome that produces the polypeptides according to the information encoded in the messenger RNA. In a wider sense, the fact of the past existence of animals can be communicated to a sedimentary layer, which preserves this fact as a fossil, or, in other words, as a record, which in turn can be considered as a kind of information. Likewise, the life story of a tree is communicated to its rings, and thereby they hold information about the tree’s age. In these examples there are no senders and receivers making sense of symbolic language, but we still comfortably describe the examples by referring to “information transfer”. (p. 43-44)

The idea that notion information can be communicated through information apart from semantics is the first step in a research known as "the naturalization of information".

The second question is whether this "naturalization" can be extended to the second step human communication, namely to the extraction of meaning or semantics too? 

* Can this process be automated? 
* Is it something machine's can do as well? 
* Or is a "magic process" that humans alone are capable of? 
* Or are human beings the only type of "semantically enabled agents"?

{:.question}
Our reading hints at test case for answering question like this (p. 44, bottom). What is a possible test or method for determining whether semantics and not just information has been communicated?

{:.answer}
The reading points to the "problem of reference" 

If a receiver can receive information and then accurately locate a correspondence between this information and a referent, then we might be inclined to say that this is a case in which "semantics" have been communicated. 

[possible connection here to Marche's assertion that "data is not literature"; possible link or annotation here]

A key question lies in what is required of information and a receiver in order to effect this kind of information.

It's worth pausing here a highlighting the are question that have actual applications in various fields of active research and development. Our author writes: 

> Understanding the fundamentals of this problem is beneficial to appreciate current debates on neuro-physiology (“When does the transduction of information stop and when does the interpretation start within the brain?”), artificial intelligence (“Can we build semantically enabled artificial agents?”), and metaphysics (“Is information the ultimate substance of the universe?”).

Our goal here is only to get the smallest glimpse at what is going on in these fields, while hopefully alerting you to the fact that these areas of research exist. A quick google search and you will find a vast array of readings that will let you explore these topics further.

# Dretske's Approach (as overviewed by Philosophy of Information, sections 3.3-3.5)

## Environmental Information (section 3.3)

As discussed, the question of communication is theorized as twofold. 

The process of communicating information and the extraction of semantics.

While separate it is assumed that they are related. 

Thus, the concept of "environmental information" is inspected in more detail.

<span class="respond"/> What is Floridi's definition of "environmental information"? Can you provide an annotation that links to his definition?

<span class="respond"/> Can you provide your own concrete example of "environmental information" different from the examples given (see p. 45)?

{:.question}
How does "environmental information" differ from "semantic information"?

<div class="answer">
Critical seems to be the coupling of two states, but that this coupling "does not depend on a preceding agreement on a code" 

To me this, this sounds a bit like what "medieval" thinkers would call a natural sign as opposed to an artificial sign. 

A natural sign might be "smoke from a fire" or a "footprint in the sand left from a shoe". There is a coupling here and someone could learn from the smoke that there is a fire or that someone previously walked on the beach, but there was prior agreement on a code. 

Morse code or even a word in a language would be an example of an artificial sign

</div>

So, as our text states: 

> "Environmental information covers the first part of the naturalization, the natural transfer of information. The tree’s age is communicated to its own physical structure. But an observer must still interpret the structure to extract the information" (p. 46)

"Environmental Information" seems to cover the transfer of information, but we need to question how an agent can interpret that information, identify a reference, or identify a meaning (which is perhaps three ways of saying the same thing.)

## Equivocation (section 3.4)

Dretske first shows that even humans ("semantically enabled agents") often communicate information without semantics.

{:.question}
What example is taken from Dretske? 

{:.answer}
> "On the other hand, an event or state of affairs that has no meaning in any conventional sense may carry substantial amounts of information. An experienced poker player can read the signs; he can tell, or be reasonably certain, when a bluff is in progress. His opponent’s nervous mannerisms, excessively high bet, and forced appearance of confidence reveal, as surely as would a peek at his last card, that he did not fill his inside straight. In such a situation information is communicated, but the vehicle that carries the information (opponent’s behaviour and actions) has no meaning in the relevant conventional or semantic sense."
(Dretske, 1981) (p. 46)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
<span class="respond"> What are some other examples of "semantically enabled agents" communicating without semantic information?
</div>

In such a process, Dretske highlights the importance of a direct coupling between two states which he says is "unequivocal"

But what then does "equivocation" mean? 

> "Equivocation occurs if several different events at the source are conflated into one observed event with the receiver, thereby rendering it impossible to infer exactly which event at the source produced the event with the receiver." (p. 46)

To understand Dretske's difference between "causal transfer" and "information transfer"

When there is "equivocation", then these multiple states at the source can said to be "causal transfer" but not an "information transfer" (p. 46)

[examaple here]

It is helpful to remember that for Dretske: "every information transfer is a causal transfer, but not every causal transfer is an information transfer"

In sum: 
> "At any rate, it should be clear by now what it means for environmental information to pass through a channel that is equivocation-free: it means that information is not irreversibly lost." (p. 46)

We are still not talking about the extraction of "Semantic Information", but the idea is that if there is going to be "Semantic extraction", we're going to need "unequivical information transfer". 

As our text says at the end of section 3.4

> "Equivocation-free transfer of information therefore prepares the way for the extraction of the content from the signal." (p. 47)

## Digitalization and semanticisation (section 3.5)

[TODO: use below three quotes as basic outline; needs to be filled out, explained, with examples ]

To what we have said above we can add the idea of "intentional states" 

[TODO: intention states , p. 49]

With the idea of an equivocation-free channel and intention states we can how there is a pathway toward resolving the "problem of reference" introduced at the outset.

> "By means of the equivocation-free channel and the intentional states, we already understand better how reference is possible, how one structure can carry information about another structure. For example, the experience of a sound we hear is intentional with respect to the object that produces the sound, not with respect to the vibration of our ear drums, although the latter is implied by our having the experience." p. 49

Now with the possibility of "reference", Dretske adds a distinction between information about facts and information about types. 

And with the concept of types, he try to explain how "meaning" can emerge (naturally)

[TODO: Explain]

> "Now, with regards to how natural information can give rise to symbolic communication, another important idea is required: the difference between a piece of information about a particular matter of fact, and the corresponding content the information has on a type level." (p. 49-50)

[TODO: Explain]

> "A meaning is a symbol connected to a concept on type level. The symbol can represent a concept in the sense of a genuine convention, but this is not necessarily so, since a symbol can gradually acquire its meaning." (p. 50)

[TODO: Explain]

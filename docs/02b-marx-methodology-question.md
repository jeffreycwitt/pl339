Dear Rick, 

I'm preparing a new course for the fall which has led me to some questions about Marx. Since you sometimes teach a class on Marx and Marxism, I was hoping I could direct it at you. I was wondering if you have some thoughts or ideas about further reading that could point me in the right direction.

So here goes:

The class I'm building is awkwardly titled: "Philosophy, Information, and Media", and I hope to frame it around the aphorism of Marshal McLuhan, "the medium is the message". 

I understand one dimension of this to be: the medium through which we receive information is not indifferent to the ultimate message we receive. If we access a message through a book, or television, or the internet, the message is different. Or at least our consciousness is affected differently. 

This ideas strikes me as similar to Marx's claim in the "German ideology" that "consciousness does not determine life, but LIFE determines consciousness".

Thus, as I introduce the course, I hope to do a little reading and reflection about the ways that material structures (or media) effect the ultimate "message" we receive. 

On this point, I have some good examples from "disability studies" and Judith Butler: for example the impact on "consciousness" that occurs when curb cuts are introduced to an urban environment and how our consciousness of "normalcy" changes as a result of curb cuts. 

But here's my problem: I also want to work with the students on evaluating media forms, just as a Marxist theorist might want to evaluate a particular economic system. So for example, we might ask what are the positives of the "book form"? What genuine value might be lost if we cease to use the book form? Conversely, what are the advantages of the internet as medium? What genuine values are gained by adopting this new medium? Might these new values outweigh the losses of an old medium?

But all of this is predicated on the ability for us to see "genuine values", and therein lies my question.

If, as the "German Ideology" states, "material life determines consciousness", it would seem hard for anyone to ever get into a position where they could glimpse an eternal or objective value, by which a system could be evaluated. 

If each economic system produces its own ideas and corresponding notion of reality, then won't our consciousness be perfectly suited to this system? Thus, how can we ever get ourselves into a position by which we could critique the system in which we live? And if this is possible, doesn't this presuppose that we possess some sort of consciousness or rationality NOT determined or affected by our material life or the underlying economic systems?

A parallel question is emerging for me as I prepare my course on the impact of media on consciousness. If the media we use to think, ultimately determines how we think, how could we ever get ourselves into a position to evaluate it. Won't our evaluation reinforce the media paradigm within which we learned to think. 

Plato in the Phaedrus of course is very critical of the emerging literary culture, but we could easily just say this is because he was educated in an oral culture. Thus of course he is going to critique literary culture because oral culture has taught to value certain things over others. 

Similarly, as most of us have been raised in "book culture", won't our evaluation of the the book as "medium" reflect our already absorbed bias of the dominant medium. 

I have one really great quotation here to illustrate the dilemma from Sven Birkerts in his book "Gutenberg Elegies". Here Birkerts talks about his love for physical books and his anxiety about the information revolution. He writes:

“I worry not only that the world will become increasingly alien and inhospitable to me, but also that I will be gradually coerced into living against my NATURAL GRAIN, forced to adapt to a pace and a level of technological complexity that does not suit me, and driven to interact with others in certain prescribed ways.” (p. 28)

I think this quote is great because he talks his habit of book reading as "his natural grain", as if modern sustained silent personal reading were NATURAL and not a unique practice that only emerged in the modern era. Thus, book reading is not an objective value for Bikerts but a value he has received from going up in a particular time and culture. Thus I see this as an example of the system or medium determining Birkerts evaluation from the outset.

But back to my concrete question. Is there a way to escape this circle? Is there a Marxist inspired methodology for rising above the consciousness that the underlying material life generates? Can you think of any articles, books, or thinkers that might explain this process?

It seems to me there must be something. Marx is certainly critical of current economic systems. This must mean, de facto, that the he is able to think beyond the current dominant system. So how does he do it?

Similarly, the first architects of the internet and networked information were able to generate plenty of criticism of the book form, and thus they were able to think outside the influence of the current dominant medium. 

I imagine an answer might include some kind of distinction within consciousness or rationality, perhaps between naive or default consciousness and critical consciousness. Thus when Marx says "life determines consciousness", he must mean that the dominant system and ruling ideas determine my immediate default thinking. But this does not mean I'm trapped. Rather, via some from of critical methodology, I must be able to escape this default thinking and engage in critical consciousness. And further, I must be able to see some kind of objective structures upon which I can judge a system as helpful or hurtful to human flourishing. After all, somehow Marx must have been able to accurately see the essence of human beings as "creative workers" and thereby be in a position to judge or critique systems that "alienate" human beings from this essence.

Ok, so that's it. In short: I'd love to find a couple of articles from Marxist theorists that offer suggestions of how it is possible for a system (or material media) to influence consciousness and at the same time for consciousness to transcend this system and thereby be in a position to evaluate it.

I know this was unsolicited and long, and you are in no way obliged to respond. However, if you can think of anything that might be relevant I'd be very interested to hear from you. 

Likewise, I sometimes find writing emails tedious and would rather just chat, so if you have some ideas but would rather have a quick Zoom chat I would love that. Just suggest a time. 

I hope you're having a great summer and finding time to sail on the boat!

Best,

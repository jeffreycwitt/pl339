# Review

# Nicholas Carr, the Shallows c. 6

In chapter 6 Carr turns his attention to the growing popularity of E-Readers and quotes a few people who are self-identified book lovers and notes their attraction and enthusiasm for the kindle. 

{:.question}
Question: For example, why does L. Gordon Crovitz like the Kindle and why does Carr think he his enthusiasm is ill-founded?

{:.answer}
> "Crovitz has fallen victim to blindness that McLuhan warned against; the inability to see how a change in a medium's form is also a change in its content." (p. 102)

But is this really the case? In the comparison to the kind of hypertext editions and potential for new hierarchies that we've been discussing, the switch to an e-reader still seems fairly "bookish" to me, it still seems fully embedded in the print-paradigm. 

{:.question}
How does Carr see the shift to an e-reader subtly affecting consciousness?

{:.answer}
p. 102-103: the problem seems to lie in its connectivity, its ability to connect everything else and the immediate accessibility of everything else. 

{:.question}
What does Carr/Updike mean when he says the digital book (even just in e-reader form) loses its "edges" (p. 104: ). Why are these edges important?

{:.answer}
they keep us focused. p. 104 "the LINEARITY of the printed book is shattered" 

<div class="discussion">
How does this compare to the concerns with imposed "linearity" by the likes of Bush, Nelson, and Roland Barthes?

How are we supposed to weigh the pros and cons here? Or is there no way to speak of better and worse, but only the ability to recognize that every gain comes with loss??
</div>

{:.question}
Objection: Why can't we just say, don't follow the link. Stay where you are?

{:.answer}
I think we say that, but then we're having a discussion about theory and not about practice. If we believe Carr, then empirical studies seem to show that on the whole we can't stop ourselves from following these links. And therefore, though it may not be NECESSARY, it nevertheless remains true that the dominant use of media shift is changing us.

{:.question}
p. 105: How might distracted reading lead to changes in writing, bring the effects of a media shift into a reinforcing circle. 

{:.answer}
p. 106: Judith Curr, Simon and Schuster: "You can't just be linear anymore with your text" (other examples, embedding videos into books, etc. )

{:.question}
p. 107: What does Carr say about the "finality" and "permanence" of the printed book? How does he think this compares to digital medium? Why is this important?

{:.answer}
Carr seems to the content on the internet as constantly moving and changing. The dynamism praised by someone like Nelson seems, in Carr's mind, to threaten the possibility of a fixed reference: "a fixed reference which he seems to regard a necessary for deep thinking


**NOTE:** I'd like to note here a tension between the dominant use of a medium and the possibilities of medium. 

One the one hand is absolutely false (and uninformed) to say that we cannot create "immutable" digital objects. 

On the other hand, it is true that the web at the present functions primarily through look ups on "mutable objects" (via location-based lookups) (link to IPFS) (connection here to lessig and the way the "code" makes something artificial and contingent feel natural and necessary.)

But this doesn't mean we won't see in the future new developments that promote lookups of "immutable objects (via content-based lookups)

The point is simply that the digital medium at the present doesn't enforce or demand the social practice that he critiques. 

Nevertheless, the dominant social practice (at present) tends in the direction of his critique. 

My question, for myself, (as a scholar and builder) is to what extent this means we need to be wary of the shift to the digital medium, or to what extent we need to be wary of social inertial and market forces that determining how we use that medium. And instead of rejecting the shift, maybe my scholarly responsibility lies in contributing to social uses of that medium that are driven scientific demands rather than market forces.

# Nicholas Carr, the Shallows c. 7

This tension between "forcing/necessitating" and "tending/rewarding" [write on board] seems to be acknowledged by Carr in chapter 7.

The focus of this chapter shifts to an examination of early brain research on the effects of reading on the web. 

p. 116, top: here he admits that the web/internet reading doesn't necessitate 'cursory' reading, but this is type of the reading that the TECHNOLOGY "encourages and rewards". 

Even here I want to be a bit cautious. Is it the technology that "encourages" this or is it the social economy, the APPS we have built, and that pushes us to exploit the potentials within the medium in certain ways.

To be sure, the digital technology opens up the possibility for new kinds of user-interfaces that have clearly been attractive to commercial interest. 

<div class="discussion">
Discussion: But does it seem possible that we could design interfaces that encourage deeper think/reading? Or am I too optimistic here?

Examples: Are there examples of an encountering electronic texts in interfaces that promote concentrated reading/writing?
</div>

<div class="discussion">
Question: Does the design of an interface place a responsibility on the author or information creator that wasn't present before? 

I mean: if the printed book had natural limits, then I, as an author, could assume that the text I write would appear (or be presented) within the confines of limited range of presentation possibilities. No matter what publisher I give it to, I know that it will be presented on paper, in a static form, adhering to a standard visual encoding that all literary people can decipher. 

But it is less clear that this is the case today. 

Do we therefore as scholars/researchers/content creators need to take a deeper interest in the construction of our interfaces. To design suitable interfaces, or at least recommend interfaces where the author thinks this information is best read. (If I focus on just creating data, should the author/editor be concerned with the design of presentations or is that someone else's job). 
</div>

And perhaps it doesn't change Carr's point. We can offer multiple interfaces, but if social gravity tends toward multi-tasking interface, then the social effects he describes are still taking place, even if they are not strictly speaking necessary.

{:.question}
p. 116-117, Question: Why does Carr say that, if we set out to design a machine to re-wire the brain quickly and efficiently, we would have invented something like the Internet. What is it about the dominant environment of the web that makes this so?

<div class="answer">
> p.117: "the net also provides a high-speed system for delivering responses and rewards -- "positive reinforcements," in psychological terms -- which encourage the repetition of both physical and mental actions...."
> p. 117 "it also turns us into lab rats constantly pressing levers to get tiny pellets of social or intellectual nourishment"
</div>

<div class="discussion">

Does the messiness of an elaborate printed critical editions escape this critique? Is Carr's critique valid only to certain kinds of texts (novels, monographs etc.)

Is it possible to think that the critical edition, the scholarly reference book, has always been overloaded with multiple kinds of information all vying for the reader's attention?

Or is the "reference work" online somehow still more distracting than the "reference work" in print. 

p. 118: "The Net seizes our attention only to scatter it"
</div>


Discussion: I think we also need to step back from Carr's critique and think once more about the categories of evaluation. 

Unless we can identify some sort of eternal structures of good and bad, by which we can evaluate the pros and cons and these changes to our brain, we have to admit that Carr's ideas about positive and negative brain function are themselves determined by the medium which has dominated his life (namely the print medium). 

If the goal/ideal is to consume information in the way we have during the reign of the printed book, then it is not hard to see the changes he describes as negative. 

Just as if the goal was to be able to memorize vast sums of information (as it might be for Socrates), then one can easily see that the invention of writing is a negative development, and obstacle against the achievement of that goal. 

But of course, the digital medium is also engendering new kinds of brain activity that the printed book was not? How do we compare these skills against the skills of the past?

Carr certainly acknowledges that a "trading of skills" takes place: 

> p. 121: "We gain new skills and perspectives, but lose old ones"

But I'm less convinced that he's given me a rock-solid foundation to justify the valuing of one set of skills over another.

(See also p. 139, where Carr points to the strengthening of other skill through the use of the internet)

See article by Sam Anderson "In Defense of Distraction" 2009, New York Magazine, cited by Carr on p. 140: article points to some of the new mental advantages created by use of the Internet

> p. 141: quote from Patricia Greenfield: "every medium develops some cognitive skills at the expense of others"

In response to the above quotations Carr writes:

p. 141: "the Net is making us smarter, in other words, only if we define intelligence by the Net's own standards."

But isn't Carr equally criticizing this new intelligence on by defining intelligence by the "Printed Book's Standards"? 

Or is he appealing to a universal standard of intelligence that belongs to the essence of what it means to be a human being and human flourishing??

**Another concern**

{:.question}
p. 121-122: what different sets of skills, according to brain research, are being promoted by linear book reading and internet-surfing?

{:.answer}
Answer: language, memory, visual processing vs. decision making and problem solving.

The emphasis of decision-making here seems noteworthy.

I find this interesting: This suggests to me that even if I try to remain focused on reading an electronic page (that is to refuse to follow hyper-links, but instead remain focused on the linear links) but where I know hyper-links are available, that I'm already necessarily involved in decision making tasks (decisions to not follow a link) that are competing with my sentence or paragraph interpretation skills. 

(See also p. 125, the two most dominant sources of cognitive over-load are "extraneous problem-solving and divided attention")

> p. 126-127: Hyperlinks as a direct example of contributing to cognitive overload. Studies show less retention when reading a document with hyperlinks. 

**A possible response**
I might agree and but once more I would make a distinction. 

Hyperlinks, as discussed here, are a presentation and user experience decision. 

It is also possible to create data in way that preserves data connections and then use these links to create new texts or new text hierarchies. 

But then it is completely possible to view these "dynamically constructed text" in print or in an interface with distracting hyperlinks visually presented on the page. 
 
In other words, I don't think Carr's critique yet full appreciate this critical distinction between structured data and the presentation of that data.

[Example from lombardpress decisions to minimize hyperlinks][hidden paragraph menu]

<div class="discussion">
Discussion: p. 130 critique of multimedia presentations, such as text with video. 
How does this strike you? True or false? Over stated, overgeneralized? 
</div>

On the one hand it makes sense to me.

But I can also think of lots of things of learned on the internet via an image or video that made infinitely more clear what in writing was not. 

Part of this seems to me to have to do with the subject matter at hand. And I think it is interesting the way we constantly reduce all information to something common, when in fact it can be dramatically different and therefore different kinds of information might be better experienced in different ways. 

Is a critical apparatus really the best way to experience or understanding information about variants? Isn't an image a better vehicle here? 

I've taken a lot of coding class online. Most of these involve an instructor speaking and showing via a video. This is infinitely more informative to me that an article. An article is typically useful to me after I already have high level of understanding and need to clarify a particular point. 

p. 131: perhaps Carr acknowledge this on p. 131 but notes, "the internet, however, wasn't built by educators to optimize learning. It presents information not in a carefully balanced way but as a concentration-fragmenting mishmash"

p. 131, bttm: "The Net is, by design, an interruption system, a machine geared for dividing attention.

What "Internet" is he talking about here. Is the internet one thing? Wouldn't it be better to say, "this website is not well-designed" and "this website is well-designed"?

The accusation against the Internet or the "The NET" as some sort of monolith is what strikes me as wrong. 

The "net" is a lot of things and it has a lot of competing designs.

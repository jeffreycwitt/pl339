# Introduction: Reading as a latent ambiguities

NOTE: if i can introduce the notion of a latent ambiguity, then in unit 2 one way we could approach reading in an age of new media is by considering how a latent ambiguity hidden within the idea of reading is exposed by media shifts. 

Reading, chapter 7 of Lessig, Transation vs. Latent Ambiguity

Question: Do we know what it means to "read"? 

We use the term often as if means something specific, but if we inspect it close enough can the word "reading" mean different things, either slightly different or dramatically different.

Obviously, we read books. 

But don't we also read maps? Is this the same activity or a different activity?

We read the stars. We read signs. We read people. 

If we confine ourselves just to the medium of the book, do we find ambiguity about the word reading or have we find a precise concept?

What we confined ourselves to a novel, is there a distinct notion of reading here?

Even here it seems like, in addition to reading, I could "skim" read. And these are modalities that technology makes possible. 

Imagine a book that only allowed you to read "sentence by sentence". This might make "skim reading" difficult. 

But in the midst of a sea of meanings? 

Is there a privileged idea of "reading", an ideal picture of reading and the reader? 

Perhaps: "Deep sustained silent reading"

Question: Does anyone remember school activities called "sustained silent reading"

My question here is to what extent the medium of the booked has shaped or determined this "value". 

Or better, in the spirit of a "latent ambiguity" is there a way in which the technology necessitates this kind of reading, so that we have never been forced to explicitly identify it as a value in need of protecting.

If so, what is valuable kind of reading, to what extent is it or can it be threatened by technological shifts. 


What counter forces should be weighed against it. Are there other potential values to be achieved by allow this mode of reading to be reduced or threatened?

NOTE: presumably we will have seen this dynamic before with Ong and the transition to writing (creating the loss of memory, but a new consciousness of ideas, logic, 2nd order discourse etc.)

## Reading Before Print

It might helpful for us to think about reading before the modern era. 

Obviously people read, but the notion of silent reason was practically unknown. (perhaps text or excerpts here from "spaces between words")

The goal of reading was to read aloud so that others could here it.

So now image that a machine comes a long which can "recite" the text allowed. Now, no one needs to read, because the "end goal" of reading has been achieved by other means. 

Has there been a loss? or progress? In such a world, we might imagine that soon no one knows how to decipher the scribbles on the page because there is no need to know how to do this. 

Is this a bad or a good development.

## The invention of silent reading

Mass silent reading is a modern phenomenon, which was and as common vehicle for accomplishing the many purposes and tasks we achieve through reading (various and distinct kinds information retrieval, entertainment)


## Latent ambiguity

We might call this a "latent ambiguity" because in a world where "reading" a text was the only way to extract/communicate information, we never had to ask is this activity valuable in and of itself. And if so, what precisely is it that ought to be valued. 


## Reading After Print

If today, we read in order to obtain information, and that information can be more quickly or effectively communicated through a picture or a video, and therefore we cease to read. 

Is this a good or bad development?

## Distant reading

Is it possible that an obsession with reading physically words blocks or hinders from other kinds of "reading experiences". 

What is distant reading? What is thought to be valuable? 

(Pro and con article.) 

Question: Does the pursuit of information reception through other means threaten "silent reading" or can they be complementary

## Comparable examples: Writing

We could ask similar questions about writing.

If the goal of writing is to communicate, let's say the events of a baseball game or a legal proceedings report. (article about this possibility, or lab/demo)

If program and AI bot to effectively compose this sports report or legal report, and therefore I write less and less, is my human experience diminished somehow? Or is this comparable to the way most of no longer remember phone numbers, but few of us complain that this is a genuine loss.

The possibility of communicating via written text without ever writing was not something previously imagined, thus we never really had to take stand on the value of the pure writing act, because it was deemed necessary whether we valued it or not. But if it is no longer necessary, it forces the question of value upon us with new urgency.


In the next 8 or so class I want to explore various people writing on topics that relate to these questions. 

I want to begin in 20th century with practitioners and philosophers that express frustration with the limitations placed on the experience of reading by the medium. Here our interest is in new horizons that might be opened when information is communicated in different forms or how the experience of reading might enrichment through the expansion or revaluation of the "best kind of reading". 

So we will look and this 
1) from the prospective of computer scientists and visionaries of the coming internet (Bush, and Nelson), 
2) from literary studies and the potentials of "hypertextual reading", 
3) from the idea of distant and middle distant reading

Once we see the new possibilities, we will hopefully have laid the "latent ambiguity" bare. 

Then I want to look at some critics of new media: voices that want to defend the idea that there is something extremely valuable about the act of sustained silent deep reading, and that as a value it must be defended, when previously it did not need a defense because it was technological demanded.

And at the end I want to ask a final speculative question: whether or not new technologies is of necessity a threat or whether it can be complimentary. If it can both be threatening and complimentary, then I'm interested in defining the conditions under which new media threatens and under which new media compliments or even enriches.

# As We May Think

primary focus, starting around p. 8?? 
	(p. 8 voder, vocoder, example of encoding voice sound in more efficient and adaptabl ways, making it possible to move, save, and transport voice)

Questions: 

In general, how we do describe the research environment that Bush imagines? 

In what was does the improve over the research environment confined to the state page?

In the opening pages he points how much research is lost. 
P. 3, he offers the example of Mendel and and the concept of laws of genetics lost to research because of insufficient access
p. 3 "and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential"
p. 3 "The difficult seems to be...that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record"

p. 9: we would benefit from mechanical aids to "essentially repetitive thought"

p. 9-10: What are the repetitive thoughts we encounter
obviously basic arithemtic, 

p. 10: But "the repetitive processes of thought are not confided however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine."

In other words, the construction, recording, and recalling of data relationships is also something that machine could help up us with, but is often overlooked.

p. 11, it worth nothing the language that Bush uses of "freeing the brain" and "relief...from laborious detailed manipulation" and the general distinction between creative and repetitive tasks, stands in fairly stark contrast to Socrates concern about writing as a way of out sourcing memory. Bush sees precisely this outsourcing and a way to free the brain for "creative cognitive acts" in contradistinction from "repetitive tasks", perhaps precisely the routine of repetition that were so highly valued by a purely oral culture.

p. 12: "Whenever logical processes of thought are employed--that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted groove--there is an opportunity for the machine."

But, as a side note, we also seem him complaining of an inhibitor to progress that is similar to the concern we've looked already, namely the "visual encoding of scholarly information".

p. 12 "Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They imply a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field" [could we say the same thing about the notation of a scholarly edition]

p. 12, bttom: But back to the main point, the computer could be useful for the generation of data, but also the "selection of data". (see beginning of section 6, bttm of p. 14)

p. 15, "Selection by association, rather than by indexing, may yet be mechanized"

p. 15, top, begin description of memex machine

p. 17, top: "this is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing."

In the constructions of trails of association, what seems to be to be the remarkable things is the RE-USE of information (at a granular level, a paragraph here, a photo, a page, etc) in NEW-CONTEXTS. The construction of NEW-HIERARCHIES (new kinds of associations) from old HIERARCHIES. This strikes me at once as both a simple innovation, and a startling powerful one from the point of view research discovery.

p. 17 "and he trails to do not fade" This also strikes me as important. In many cases, in research, we build associative trails in order to arrive at a conclusion. We then right an article and with our conclusions casting aside the trail. 

The ability to save and name the trail creates the possiblity of future re-use and future-re-discovery that is often lost in scholarship. 

What are the limits of his vision?

p. 15: The associations he seems are largely limited to the associations made by an individual researchers. He does not yet see the possibility of social connectivity as we know it today

Do we see any concerns or drawbacks back with the research environment he envisions?

# Literary Machines

[literary machines] (15 minutes)

Question: From reading these texts, what do you see as they most fundamental frustration with the existing state of information and the communication of information?

[point to passages that students can quickly review]

In Nelson in particular, I see at least two specific concerns repeatedly stated in different ways.

1) Critique of imposed “sequence” or “linearity”. 

Nelson p. 1/14: “We are used to sequential writing, and so we come easily to suppose that writing is intrinsically sequential.”

Nelson identifies two problems in particular: 

Nelson. P. 1/14: “1) it spoils the unity and structure of interconnection. 2) It forces a single sequence for all readers which may be appropriate for some. 


Perhaps we could focus on just these two concerns for a moment. 

## Concern 1: spoils the unity and structure of interconnection 

**Question**: Are there ways that “visually encoded data” “spoils the unity and structure of interconnection”?

How does the static nature of printed text spoil this sense of interconnectedness?

How have printed texts tried to overcome these limitations (cross-references, indices)

Even cross references and references are limited by space and many things are left out. 

Do cross references include bi-directional links? Usually not.

Examples of bi-directional vs. uni-directional linking 

Concrete example of digital editions, even in TEI encoding the "look" of a references and not the information, preventing bidirectional links

Consider: http://rrp.stanford.edu/MMet.shtml
and TEI http://rrp.stanford.edu/MMet.xml

all footnotes encoded in <app>, <title> <author> encoded with <I> for italics, presentational markup, and the references itself does not have a target only visual text. 

But even in a printed edition, is the text or string of text actually the information? Or the thing being pointed to. The string has just been an imprecise pointer?

The question, how can we encode this with enough precision (less entropy) to make it reliably machine actionable.

 ## Concern 2:  single sequences are not always appropriate for everyone.

Shanon's concept of information, in the pursuit of efficiency, asks us to be more precise. 

This precision occurs when we think about constructing data that can automatically be manipulated from medium to medium with requiring a human agent to understand its semantics and then re-encode. 

This is because, in away the information carries the semantics with enough percision and efficiency that it is possible for a machine to compute and transmit it without the semantics being lost. 

Such precision in turn allow for more dynamism in display and experience of content. 

But we live in two worlds here. We live in a world where we don't think about our texts in this way. 

We live in a world in which we anticipate the primary use to be the "reading" by a human. 

This leads to a kind of imprecise encoding (and inefficiency, that makes it prohibitively expensive for machines to compute and transmit.)

### Why are metaphors holding us back

"Barley beyond the book" stuff here about "paradigmatic regression"

Because we still think about data as visually encoded from the era when it was necessarily so, we continue to do so today, even though the medium no longer necessitates it. 

And in this way we restrict the possibilities of the new medium


### What does this look like in practice. 

Activity: Visual encoding vs. Semantic encoding 

Demonstration: What is a text articles and the possibilities of retrieving text by content (OHCO) rather than page. (Ad fontes demonstration.)

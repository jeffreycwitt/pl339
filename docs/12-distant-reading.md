# Review 

Thus far, we have discussed three main categories where philosophers and theorists have pointed to the digital medium as making advances over the old medium.

* access immediacy (Bush)
* interconnectivity and context (Bush, Nelson)
* non-linearity or multi-sequence (Neslon, Landow)

Today, I want to look at a fourth category, that we might call: 

* machine accessibility or machine assisted analysis

Here I mean that the text is not merely accessible to human readers, but also accessible in a form that it can be "acted upon" by machines with the result that the machine can assist in new forms of analysis (or is this a type of "reading"?).

We will try to get a glimpse of this approach and its potential benefits by looking at some of the writings by one of the pioneers of a controversial approach to literature, Franco Moretti. Moretti calls this approach "distant reading".

# Moretti: The Problem of Studying Literature and new Challenge

According to Moretti in Graphs Maps and Tress-1 (2003), p. 67, the study of literature faces a problem.

> It’s an idea that occurred to me some years ago, when the study of national bibliographies made
me realize what a minimal fraction of the literary field we all work
on: a canon of two hundred novels, for instance, sounds very large for
nineteenth-century Britain (and is much larger than the current one), but
is still less than one per cent of the novels that were actually published:
twenty thousand, thirty, more, no one really knows—and close reading
won’t help here, a novel a day every day of the year would take a century
or so . . . And then, a field this large cannot be understood by stitching
together separate bits of knowledge about individual cases, because it
isn’t a sum of individual cases: it’s a collective system, that should be
grasped as such, as a whole..." (Moretti, 2003, p. 67-68)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

How does this concern resurface in his essay, "Conjectures on World Literature"?

{:.rquestion}

</div>

Here are couple of passages that I found which speak to the need for machine assisted analysis.

> "But I actually think that it's our greatest chance, because the
sheer enormity of the task makes it clear that world literature cannot
be literature, bigger; what we are already doing, just more of it. It has
to be different. The categories have to be different. 'It is not the "actual"
interconnection of "things"', Max Weber wrote, 'but the conceptual
interconnection of problems which define the scope of the various
sciences. A new "science" emerges where a new problem is pursued by
a new method.' That's the point: world literature is not an object, it's
a problem, and a problem that asks for a new critical method: and no
one has ever found a method by just reading more texts. That's not how
theories come into being; they need a leap, a wager-a hypothesis, to
get started." (Moretti, "Conjectures", 2000, p. 55)

The idea is that the study of "world literature" is a problem, which cannot be solved by "more reading" within the normal paradigm. The scale is too big for any one reader to take in. Machine assisted analysis is a potential answer to this problem precisely because it **scales** to dimensions no human reader could every reach. Thus it has the potential to offer us unique glimpses at a terrain that previously remained hidden.

And again in the "Slaughterhouse of literature" (2000), Moretti says:

> "The history of the world is the slaughterhouse
of the world, reads a famous Hegelian aphorism; and of literature. The
majority of books disappear forever—and “majority” actually misses
the point: if we set today’s canon of nineteenth-century British novels
at two hundred titles (which is a very high figure), they would still be
only about 0.5 percent of all published novels." (Moretti, "Slaughterhouse", p. 207)


# Moretti: On Solving the Problem With Distant Reading

What is "distant reading"? Wikipedia gives us a pretty succinct answer: 

> "The term "distant reading" is generally attributed to Franco Moretti and his 2000 article, Conjectures on World Literature.[1] In the article, Moretti proposed a mode of reading which included works outside of established literary canons, which he variously termed "the great unread"[2] and, elsewhere, "the Slaughterhouse of Literature".[3] The innovation it proposed, as far as literary studies was concerned, was that the method employed samples, statistics, paratexts, and other features not often considered within the ambit of literary analysis. Moretti also established a direct opposition to the theory and methods of close reading: "One thing for sure: it cannot mean the very close reading of very few texts—secularized theology, really ('canon'!)—that has radiated from the cheerful town of New Haven over the whole field of literary studies".[4]" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading)

So what does Distant Reading Look like in practice? Let's look at Moretti's "First Experiment" ("Slaughterhouse", p. 212)

{:.question}
Why does he start with detective stories? What 'specific device' of exceptional visibility do they contain? ("Slaughterhouse", p. 212)

{:.answer} 
Clues. (Remember Moretti is look for "forms" in literature that can be abstracted from individual stories.) Clues are a visible feature of "form". Using a very visible "formal feature" he thinks it will be easier to assess what "distant reading" can tells about a genre's form. (A "form" also seems to be something that a machine could detect without necessarily needed to understand semantics.)

By focusing on clues he develops a kind of schematic with which to organize detective stories.

He suggests that the "tree" represents a new way of approaching literature. Consider the following quotation:

> "The branches are the result of the twists and turns of
a device, of a unit much smaller than the text. Conversely, the branches
are also part of something much larger than any text, which is the genre:
the tree of detective fiction. Devices and genres: two formal units. A very
small formal unit and a very large one: these are the forces behind this
figure—and behind literary history. Not texts. Texts are real objects—
but not objects of knowledge. If we want to explain the laws of literary
history, we must move to a formal plane that lies beyond them: below
or above; the device, or the genre." ("Slaughterhouse", p. 217)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}

What does he conclude from his analysis of the "form" of clues across many different stories, abstracted from the stories themselves?

</div>

It seems that he thinks he has found a reason to explain why some detective stories have survived and joined the "canon" while others have not. 

He also thinks he has found an interesting anomaly. Namely that some stories by Arthur Conan Doyle remained popular despite lacking the formal features needed for success. He thinks Doyle is **stumbling** through his writing, working by trial and error, not always conscious of the formal features required for success.

Moretti writes: 

> "He [Doyle] finds the epoch-making device but does not work it out? It didn’t make sense; the tree had to be wrong. But the tree was right — in the forty-odd stories Conan Doyle wrote after the Adventures, one finds exactly the same oscillations— and it actually highlighted an important Darwinian feature of literary history: in times of morphological change, like the 1890s for detective fiction, the individual writer behaves exactly like the genre as a whole: tentatively. During a paradigm shift no one knows what will work and what won’t; not Ashdown, not Pirkis, and not Conan Doyle; he proceeds by trial and error, making fewer errors early on, when the problems are simpler—and more errors later, when they are more complex. It makes perfect sense. ("Slaughter House of Literature", p. 215)

# Ascari's concerns with "Distant Reading"

As I read Acari's critique, the central thrust of his specific concern parallels a common critique of uses of big data in general (topic modelling included). 

The concern is the by speaking of "data" rather than "literature", one implicitly begins to feel that they are speaking of something suddenly objective, something pure, something free from interpretation and bias. 

But Ascari is eager to point out that data in literature is never complete or exhaustive. Thus it is always already in someway selected and curated. Accordingly, it is in some always already interpreted or biased. 

Specifically, Ascari suggest that Moretti uses the conclusions of S.S. Van Dine's in 1928 about what makes good detective fiction (namely, "functional clues" that the reader can use to solve the mystery). Moretti then organizes the data around this assumption. Specifically, he goes looking for this "form" within the detective stories of the 19th century. The result of his search becomes his objective data. 

But is this data really so "objective"? Or does it instead reflect what Moretti was already looking for as a result of the aesthetic tastes of early 20th century readers and critics?

Form this collection of data, Moretti then begins drawing conclusion. 

When a text doesn't contain this formal feature and is not popular enough survive, Moretti concludes that it is the absence of this form that explains why it was not popular. 

When the story include such clues and is popular, this confirms his presupposition, and he concludes this is why they have survived. 

And in the case of the *Adventures of Sherlock Homes*, when a popular author like Doyle does not include such clues in his story, Moretti does view this as a check on his original assumption or the objectivity of his data collection. On the contrary, Moretti concludes, as Ascari says, this is a [stumble](https://hyp.is/Jhi9PgwYEeuP-qP0-KEQ7A/s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/Ascari_2014_The_Dangers_of_Distant_Reading.pdf) in need of explanation.

Ascari, in contrast, wonders if he has only found the "appearance of a problem" based on his "distant analysis" of data (formal features) that have been selected based on the biases of the ascetic taste of early 20th century readers of detective stories.

Perhaps Doyle didn't "stumble", but purposely did not include functional clues because he was trying to do something else. Ascari worries that Moretti's approach unjustifiably rejects this possibility.

Ascari says something to this effect on p. 7: 

> Moretti’s  view  of  detective  fiction  uncritically  rests  on  the  normative  and  restrictive attitude that golden age theorists advertised as objective, adopting a self-validating  positivistic  stance.  Van  Dine  and  Knox,  however,  like  Richard  Austin  Freeman,  Dorothy  Sayers,  and  others,  were  first  and  foremost  creative  writers whose theoretical and historical constructs reflect their own practice as authors of clue puzzles. The rules to which they subscribed are no longer regarded as timelessly valid but rather as culturally situated, for in the course of the twentieth century, detective fiction deeply changed in terms of both creative writing and theoretical/historical constructs." (Ascari, p. 7)

## Topic Modelling.

While Moretti digs into a specific problem aided by distant reading, he doesn't give us a very clear picture of the specific technical methods often used in "distant reading".

While there are many methods of computer assisted analysis, "Topic Modelling" is a very common one.

Here are a few bog posts that describe the process and its application in the humanities: 

* [the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/](https://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/)
* [topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/](https://tedunderwood.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/)

Here's one quick description of what it does: 

> "If a computer were shown many academic articles, it might discover that articles containing the word reading frequently include others like interpretation, criticism, discourse. Without foreknowledge of these words' meanings, it could statistically learn that there is a useful relationship between them. In turn, the computer would be able to identify articles in which this cluster of words seems to be prominent, corresponding to humanist methods.
This process is popularly referred to as topic modeling, since it attempts to capture a list of many topics (that is, statistical word clusters) that would describe a given set of texts."

<!-- # The problem of "Canons"

Another concern for Moretti is the formation "canons" of literature and how these canons necessarily restrict our ability to appreciate literature.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> In what way does the technology/medium of the book encourage the study of literature through small canons?

<span class="respond"/> How might a shift in "media" change this dynamic?

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the trade-offs that Moretti recognize? How might the desire to see details prevent the ability to see form? How might the desire to see "form" prevent the ability to see details. How do we weigh these trade-offs.

</div>

 Moretti cites De Vany and Walls who point to the idea of a "cybercascade" (Moretti, 2000, Slaughterhouse, p. 210)

Still following De Vany and walls, Moretti describes the process of forming a canon as a filtering "feedback loop" (Moretti, 2000, "Slaughterhouse", p. 211)

A movement from a poli-centric beginning that becomes highly centralized (p. 211)

{:.question}
Why is Form important to Moretti?

{:.answer}
Moretti is eager to find a reason that accounts for an information cascade and the formation of a canon through market filtering. He sees "form" as key: (p. 37: "...my thesis here is that what makes readers like this or that book is form")

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

If we take it that a central part of what literary scholars do is ask about **form** (what form is used, how did this form change over time), influence (who influence this author), rhetorical strategies (e.g. how does an author create a particular effect?)

<span class="respond"/> How might the confinement of data to the printed page and the close reading of a cannon distort our understanding of form? What examples can you think of?

<span class="respond"/> What other kinds of distortions?

I can speak about this phenomenon from my own field and experience. The degree to which Thomas Aquinas towers over the middle ages, thoroughly distorts our view of his actual influence in the Middle Ages. Today people see Thomas Aquinas as somehow synonymous with medieval theology and philosophy, despite the fact that the Middle Ages extends for nearly a 1,000 years. But while Thomas Aquinas is certainly important, it is hard to see that by reading Aquinas one has clear understanding of what took place over those two centuries.

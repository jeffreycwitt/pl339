# Intro


Today we want to focus on Lessig's analysis of the legal notion of "translation" why, within a landscape of shifting medium, the legal ideal of "translation" is not always possible. He thesis is that when we understand "code" and "architecture" an already regulating force, we will be able to see that sometimes the regulation hides from us certain questions of value. 

It is only as the medium shifts and this architecture changes that we confront these questions of value of first time. Lessig here introduces the language I've introduced before: namely the notion of a "Latent Ambiguity".

In such cases translation is impossible because the legal precedent never made a decision on the question of value because they were never confronted with such a value. 

Today, we will work with Lessig's text to make sure we are clear about what "translation" is and when "latent ambiguities" arise. 

We will look at the *Olmstead vs United States* case, the opinions of Taft and Brandeis, Lessig's analysis to get a picture of what legal "translation" looks like. 

In getting a sense of what translation looks, we hope also to get a negative image of instances where translation is not possible, and thus reveal a "latent ambibuity" and how to respond in such cases.

Then in Lessig's 10th chapter we will look at his first example of such a case where a Latent Ambiguity occurs, namely "intellectual property". Here we want to see why an a "latent ambiguity" emerges and why, in light of changes in the "code", why the past legal tradition does not give us enough information to merely translate the old law into the present.

# Lessig Chapter 9

## Olmstead vs United States

[facts of the case]

## Brandeis's Translation

## Professor Tribe's legal idea of translation (p. 165-166)

## "Confrontation clause" as a latent ambiguity (p. 166)

## Traditional responses to latent ambiguities (p. 167)

Passive (let the legislature decide) p. 167

Active: "the court finds a way to articulate constitutional values that were not present at the founding"

{:.question}
Why is Lessig concerned about the passive judicial response and leaving it to legislature to decide questions of constitution value? (p. 167)

<div class="answer">

> "in our day constitutional discourse at the level of the legislature is very thin sort of discourse."

As an aside, I think this an important point. If the intention of the constitution is in fact to be a check against direct democracy and the tyranny of the majority, then such value questions are intended to be resolved not through mere majority opinion or the impulse of the masses, but as the outcome of a deliberative process (sometime referred to as "deliberative democracy"). The question then is what are the environmental conditions needed for deliberative democracy to take place. 

Whatever these conditions these are, Lessig thinks they are more present in the judicial setting that in the legislative. 

In any case, this is just a teaser, as we will return to the idea of "deliberative democracy" soon.

# Lessig Chapter 10

Then end of chapter 9 provides us with a nice transition to chapter 10

> "Translation is one way to deal with the choices that cyberspace presents. It is one way of finding equivalence across contexts. But in four applications that follow, I press the question: Is the past enough? Are there choices the framers did not address? Are they choices that we must make"

The first example offered to us is the question of "intellectual property"

So, what do we need to establish in order to see this as a Latent Ambiguity. 

1) First: We need to understand what the traditional laws of "intellectual property" are, what values they seem to protect, and the degree to which the laws achieve these protections with the help of nature and limits of the existing "code" communications media.

2) Second: Then we need to see how new communications media make it possible that obedience to the existing laww (and the values they protect) create the possibility of new injuries and grievances that previously, in an earlier media era, these same laws would never have produced. Further, we need to see how that these old values and new injurious create a conflict, without the past offering us any guidance about how to resolve this conflict. The question of resolution, of deciding the proper way to measure injuries on either side has never been resolved because the protection of the old values never previously came at the cost of other goods. It is the change in "code" that creates this new conflict and requires to re-evalulate our commitment to the old values and how much we want to commit to them in the light new kinds of irritations and problems.

BTW: This three fold structure is a classic marxist pattern of contradiction. 

* (1) A particular material system ---> gives rise to a particular social structure and set of values (thesis)
* (2) A new material system merges ---> which co-exist with the old social structure. (anti-thesis)
  * the new system and the old values are out of sync or in contradiction
* Eventually, through struggle, a new social structure and new set of values to match the new material system (synthesis)
  * And then the process repeats itself.

The synthesis stage is not something we're ready to resolve. Lessig at this point wants to show that the conflict exist.

So let's follow Lessig and consider the first two aspects, leaving it an open question of how a new synthesis might be achieved.

## 1. the 19th century code, intellectual property laws, and their intended values

He points out around p. 192 that the inventors of copyright law lived in a world where copying was very difficult, thus copyright law only applied to a very small domain. 

Use of cultural material did not generally involve "copying" thus copyright law said very little about how people might "use" cultural material.



## 2. the new code and its conflicts

But today as cultural material becomes digital, it "use" is intertwined with making copies.

Even calling up a file from a hard drive to RAM means making a copy. Showing someone an image (via the internet) is actually the task of making a copy.

Now a set of laws that once meant to regulate a small corner of life, leaving much area for freedom, is now poised to regulate huge areas of human activity and culture that it may have never meant to regulate.

A good summary reason for this that applies to all "latent ambiguities" is that in a previous world "costs of control" were so high, that much freedom remained almost as if by the laws of nature.

But now the costs of control are becoming very cheap, threatening that freedom. (p. 196)

And where once costs ensure freedom, therefore no laws to preserve this freedom were needed, in this new world, if we still want to protect those freedoms, laws/regulation will be needed where it once was not needed.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> Where do we see example of copyright control inhibiting action that once might have been allowed because it was impossible to monitor.

<span class="respond"/> what are the pros and cons of the new increased control?

</div>


**IN SUM**

But of course, previously no one every had to say explicitly that "freedom to copy" in a way that improves culture SHOULD BE protected. It never had to be said and no one needed to make a law about it because costs of enforcing copyright protection were so high that it was unthinkable the law would apply at this level. 

Now that the costs of control are so cheap, we have to ask for the first do we want copyright control at the individual level?

# Review

With today's reading, our goal is to continue looking at the foundational arguments used to support the equation that "more speech equals greater deliberation". 

As we discussed last time, champions of deliberative democracy have long argued that the freedom of expression is critical to goals of a deliberative (rather than a direct) democracy. We began to see this in Kant's *What is Enlightenment*, today we to look closer at this argument in what is perhaps the most of famous defense of freedom of expression, John Stuart Mill's, On Liberty, Chapter 2, "on liberty of thought and discussion". From there we want to look at an equally famous contemporary philosopher Jürgen Habermas (who relies heavily on the thought of Fröbel) and his similar argument as to why deliberative democracy and the "public sphere" requires as much freedom of expression as possible. 

**NOTE: The majority of our class time will focus on the reading from Mill, so please focus your attention there first; with the time remaining, we will try to pull out a few key details from the Habermas reading.**

As always, we want to think about how the desired effects of free speech (identified by Mill and Habermas) are dependent on more than just the written law, but also on the logic of the platform, architecture, or code that makes speech possible. Within these architectures, speech will happen in certain ways, at certain speeds, with certain costs. Thus in the background, we need to constantly be asking whether or not the desired effects of free speech persists when the underlying assumptions about the platform of speech as changed. 

Sunstein (as we will see) does not always think these effects will remain when the platform has changed, and thus the equation, "more speech equal better deliberation" does not always remain true in the media landscape. This is of course getting a head of things. But it is important to keep in mind, as this is where we are headed.

# Mill, On liberty, c. 2

The argument of chapter 2 has tight structure, but Mill 19th century writing and the lack of visual cues sometimes makes it difficult to follow. 

However, Mill's conclusion offers us some clues. 
> "We have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind (on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now briefly recapitulate." <span class="citation" data-reading="SWWUUQXZ=>c. 2" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/rgRJ0idZEeuQ1Q-kowQbHA/www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm"/>

These four arguments revolve around Mill's response to a central objection: if we know the truth, why should we, a society, allowed it to be contradicted by error. 

I'd like to discuss each of these arguments in turn.

As Mill states at the outset, his response follows to main paths: 

> "It is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it. We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still." <span class="citation" data-reading="SWWUUQXZ=>c. 2" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/fWNSyidNEeu6ssPhHKjMUw/www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm"/>


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

First, he says we need to question the assumption that, since we as a society know the truth, therefore we do not need to hear these presumably false opinions.

Be prepared to provide an account of this argument.

<span class="respond"/> What is the basic argument here?

<span class="respond"/> What do you think about this argument? How far should this argument be stretched? Are there some truth so certain or are there some truths or useful, or some truths so false or dangerous, that it does not seem inappropriate to outlaw the falsehoods expression?

</div>

The argument then moves forward, by assuming the premise disputed in his first response. Let's assume, he says, that society does actually have access to the truth. Are there still important reason that a society might want to allow dissenting voices to be heard?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Noted as "second" in his final recapitulation but actually discussed last in his chapter (starting around p. 84), he notes that even if the received opinion (the dominant social belief) is "mostly true" and if the opinion is "mostly false", there it still has some important part of the truth that the "mostly false" opinion can deliver.

<span class="respond"/> What is the basic argument here?

<span class="respond"/> What examples does he give to support this argument?

<span class="respond"/> What do you think about this argument? Is it strong? Why? Are there exceptions? Why?

</div>

But then he pushes the issue even further. Let's assume (for the sake of argument) that a society's beliefs were, *per impossibile*, known to be infallibly and completely true. In this case why should we not then censor opposing positions, which we know, again, *per impossibile*, to be completely false.

Mill offers to arguments in this regard, 3 and 4 respectively in his final recapitulation


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What is the third argument? (Hint: it has something to do with understanding the "reason" or "grounds" or an opinion.) (See around p. 64.)

Again, we're looking to test his argument. So...

<span class="respond"/> Does he argument presume anything about the "platform" of speech? (Such that the argument might not follow if the "platform" where changed?)

<span class="respond"/> Are there any exceptions or extremes where his position about falsehood improving our understanding of the truth would not follow.

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What is the fourth argument? (Hint: it has something to do with understanding the "meaning" of an opinion.) (See around p. 72.)

<span class="respond"/> Why is this important? 

<span class="respond"/> What examples does he give?

Again, we're looking to test his argument. So...

<span class="respond"/> Does he argument presume anything about the "platform" of speech? (Such that the argument might not follow if the "platform" where changed?)

<!-- ## Arguments for 1. 

We are not infallibile. 

Objection, just because we are not infallible, doesn't mean we should use our best judgment to root out what is false or dangerous to the well being of society.

Why does Mill think English social intolerance might be worse that the outright hostility toward Socrates and the Christians (see p. 59)

Threat of persecution for speech teaches others to be anxious and nervous about using their own reason, thus their "mental development is cramped" (p. 61) --  perhaps the effect of "cancel culture"??)

A few great thinkers might still emerge in such an environment, but there will never be an "intellectually" active people in such an environment.

## Arguments for 2. 

Assume for the sake of argument that a societies beliefs were, per impossibile, known to be infallibile true; why should we not then censor opposing positions, which we know, again per impossibile, to be false.

difference between true opinion (knowing that it is true) and knowledge (knowing why it is true)

Even if we try to suppress opposition, some discussion will sneak in. 

And if people don't know why they believe something, they are likely to be easily swayed by a false counter opinion.

Objection around p. 70

Mill Raises new concern on p. 72 

Not only "the grounds" for an opinion might remain unknown, but also the opinion itself might be lost or confused.

The belief is no longer living. (in ability to "translate", the essence of what is said is lost, or confused with the inessential)

What's the difference between dead and living beliefs? ("dead beliefs" p. 75)

New objection on p. 80. 

"If everyone agrees, will it no longer be possible to know the truth?"

Transition, p. 84/85

## Third option

What happens when both conflicting opinions share the truth between them

concluding section around 97/98

Four reasons for free expression restated: 

2) if it is mostly false, it may contain some truth that comes out through collision (in body text this seems introduced after 3 and 4)

if it is completely false, but not heard 

3 then we will not know the "reasons" for the truth

4 or we will not understand its meaning

Final objection, the manner in which a opinion is introduced into discussion must be "temperate"

What counts as temperate? -->


# Habermas and Fröbel

Let's focus on just a few key moments through some "Guided Reading Questions".

{:.rquestion}
What tension exist between liberty and equality? 

{:.rquestion}
Why aren't the these the same?

{:.rquestion}
Why does Locke privilege liberty over equality, what is he afraid of?

{:.rquestion}
How does Rousseau attempt to overcome this concern by distinguishing between private will and real will of individuals? 

{:.question}
What difficulty does Rousseau's solution face? (We've look at this difficulty once before.)

{:.answer}
How does one actually find the general will? How does one avoid the tyranny of the majority)

{:.question}
How does Fröbel attempt to overcome this difficulty? (See pp. 46-48)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Fröbel attempts to identify the conditions and nature of **the procedure**. The outcome of which one can be confident that the general will has been achieved (or approximated) as opposed to simply achieving a majority self-interested view which thus tramples and suppresses liberty.

Fröbel's answer here seems similar to Kant's. Rather identify what the right answer is, he describes a "procedure" ("free use of public reason") whose outcome, whatever it is, will represent the command of the General Will, or "Rationality".

</div>

Habermas adds to Fröbel's view, saying: 

> "This dilemma turns our attention toward a relation Fröbel did not discuss, that  between  formally  structured political will formation and the surrounding environment of unstructured processes of opinion formation." <span class="citation" data-reading="GCYCSLUR=>p. 57"/>

Habermans suggests that discursive will-formation requires certain conditions to which Fröbel did not give sufficient attention.

{:.rquestion}
What kinds of conditions does Habermas have in mind? What kinds of conditions are necessary in order for speech to translate into deliberation?

This seems central to our discussion of the role of the medium or "platform" in determining whether or not "more speech equals better deliberation". 

{:.rquestion}
If this equation requires certain conditions to be met, what role does the available communications medium play in achieving those conditions. 

{:.rquestion} To what extend is a government justified in enacting laws or restricting freedom in order to acquire these conditions.

The "creation of the condition" creates political problems for how to achieve them. 

Resolving these problem seems to require external regulation and perhaps even force.

In the Rousseauian manner it might be possible to justify this force if it were the will of the people. 

But this is difficult, because in this case, we are talking about the conditions necessary for deliberation to take place so that the true will of the people can emerge. 

How can the will of the people be invoked to justify the conditions for deliberation, since by definition these conditions would be enforced prior to deliberation and prior to the determination of the will of the people.

Habermas writes:

> "Naturally, even a proceduralized “popular sovereignty” of this sort cannot operate without the support of an accommodating political culture,  without  the  basic  attitudes,  mediated  by  tradition  and  socialization, of a population accustomed to political freedom: rational political will-formation cannot occur unless a rationalized life world meets it halfway. This thesis could appear to be just one more guise for a civic-republican ethos and its expectations of virtue that have morally overburdened citizens since time immemorial." <span class="citation" data-reading="GCYCSLUR=>p. 59"/>

Habermas here seems to rely on or trust that there would be sufficient rationality or civic virtue within the people themselves to recognize the "rationality" of these conditions prior to deliberation itself.

In this way, he would expect individuals to recognize that intervention is justified *a priori* in anticipation of the will of the people. Conditions would be imposed that, while not, yet chosen, theoretically would be chosen if the condition were in place for healthy will formation to develop.

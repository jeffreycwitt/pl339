# Exam Format 

The exam format will consist of two parts. (1) A question section composed primarily of multiple choice or short answer questions and (2) then two essay questions asking you to explore and articulate some of the big ideas we've been discussing.

# Key Ideas

* Medium is the Message
  * What is McLuhan's central thesis?
  * How can this be understood in terms of Marx's claim that "life determines consciousness" rather than "consciousness determines life"?
  * How do Marx's "Ruling" ideas explain the power of media and it's associated values?

* Communication Modalities
  * What different kinds of characteristics do communication systems display? Can you give some examples? 

* Orality and Literacy
  * Why does "Plato" praise the "living" text of speech? How does this fit his "goals" for knowledge?
  * Why does Ong see new positives in the "dead" text? What new dimensions of human experience did this enable? How so?
  * How does the printed text affect consciousness? 
  * How do the "production economies" surrounding the printed text affect consciousness? (Consider the full meaning of "publication" or "to make public")

* Electronic Communication
  * How does the telegraph create a new problem for "communication"?
  * How does this force us to think of the "text" in a new way?
  * How did this "abstraction" enable the communication of information across "multiple" media? Why was this not possible when a text was thought of as something "written down"?
  * What problem does the "production economy" surrounding the telegraph create? 
  * How does this push us to think about information and the message differently?

* Shannon's Theory of Information
  * How did studying patterns in English texts inspire Shannon's definition of information?
  * What is Information "Entropy" a measure of?
  * How does this allow us to think about "information" as a strange kind of "medium" rather than "message"?
  * What is Shannon's formula for Information "Entropy"?
  * Can you apply this formula to simple problems? 
    * e.g. How many bits needed to communicate one letter? 
    * How many bits needed to communicate one "codon"?
    * What does it mean for a channel to communicate 100 bits/second?
    * What is the limiting factor here? Why can't it communicate 101 bits/second?
    * Approximately, how many words (in a vocabulary of 20) could be communicated per second in a channel that communicates 100 bits/second?

* How do we see information theory applied in surprising new fields?
  * Psychology
  * Physics 
  * Biology
  * Even Philosophy of Language/Semantics (see our discussion of Searle and Dretske)

<span class="respond"/> What else should be added to this list?

<span class="respond"/> Based on our reading of Gleick, everyone please offer one "multiple choice question" that they think would be a good example exam question. Then tell us why this would be a good question.

# Essay Questions

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Exam essay questions are usually designed to ask to students identify or recognize "big ideas" that are at work throughout the different examples and chapters we've been looking at. The essay is then a chance for students to show that they recognize this trend and can explain how it is at work in specific cases. 

<span class="respond"/> Thus, what do you think are the "big ideas" that have been resurfacing over the course of our reading?

<span class="respond"/> Offer an example of an "essay prompt" that would invite you to explain one of these big ideas across the different examples and chapters we've been discussing.

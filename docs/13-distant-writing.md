# "Distant Writing"

Finally, let's end with a provocative little foray into the future. 

If we can talk about distant reading, can we also talk about distant writing. 

What might that look like? Here are a few examples.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> Is this an example of computer writing or a new form of human writing?

Consider this tweet: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Increasingly it feels right to me to ascribe joint authorship to human + tool.<br><br>I went to share this, and it didn&#39;t seem right to say &quot;GPT-3 wrote this essay&quot; or &quot;Raphael asked GPT-3 to write an essay&quot;<br><br>instead: &quot;GPT-3 + Raphael wrote an essay&quot; <a href="https://t.co/SfHwBM30JO">https://t.co/SfHwBM30JO</a></p>&mdash; Catherine Olsson (@catherineols) <a href="https://twitter.com/catherineols/status/1289335703084470274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> Is the possibility of "distant writing" an example of a "Latent Ambiguity"? 

Why would we have never previously had to ask if "writing to communicate" is a good or bad thing? 

If it is a latent ambiguity and we must now for the first time deliberate over the value of writing in many genres when no longer compelled to write by sheer necessity, how should we evaluate this development?

<span class="respond"/> If a machine can write legal briefs, sports summaries, and entertainment reports and humans are no longer needed to write such articles, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Are there distinction to be made here? Is it good if humans no longer have to do certain kinds of writing, but bad if all human generated writing stops? What are the distinguishing characteristics?

<!-- # The problem of "Canons"

Another concern for Moretti is the formation "canons" of literature and how these canons necessarily restrict our ability to appreciate literature.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> In what way does the technology/medium of the book encourage the study of literature through small canons?

<span class="respond"/> How might a shift in "media" change this dynamic?

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the trade-offs that Moretti recognize? How might the desire to see details prevent the ability to see form? How might the desire to see "form" prevent the ability to see details. How do we weigh these trade-offs.

</div>

 Moretti cites De Vany and Walls who point to the idea of a "cybercascade" (Moretti, 2000, Slaughterhouse, p. 210)

Still following De Vany and walls, Moretti describes the process of forming a canon as a filtering "feedback loop" (Moretti, 2000, "Slaughterhouse", p. 211)

A movement from a poli-centric beginning that becomes highly centralized (p. 211)

{:.question}
Why is Form important to Moretti?

{:.answer}
Moretti is eager to find a reason that accounts for an information cascade and the formation of a canon through market filtering. He sees "form" as key: (p. 37: "...my thesis here is that what makes readers like this or that book is form")

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

If we take it that a central part of what literary scholars do is ask about **form** (what form is used, how did this form change over time), influence (who influence this author), rhetorical strategies (e.g. how does an author create a particular effect?)

<span class="respond"/> How might the confinement of data to the printed page and the close reading of a cannon distort our understanding of form? What examples can you think of?

<span class="respond"/> What other kinds of distortions?

I can speak about this phenomenon from my own field and experience. The degree to which Thomas Aquinas towers over the middle ages, thoroughly distorts our view of his actual influence in the Middle Ages. Today people see Thomas Aquinas as somehow synonymous with medieval theology and philosophy, despite the fact that the Middle Ages extends for nearly a 1,000 years. But while Thomas Aquinas is certainly important, it is hard to see that by reading Aquinas one has clear understanding of what took place over those two centuries.

<!-- ## In sum: Moretti's valuation of distant reading

p. 227, consider Moretti final summary of the value of "trees" as kind of "opening up.

# Other Examples of Distant Reading

There are no doubt criticisms and concerns about Moretti's approach. But I want to look at those criticism next time.

For the moment, I want to look more generally at existing techniques that are currently used in the field.

<span class="respond"/> What kinds of "distortions" imposed by a small, human-sized, canon might be overcome by these kinds of methods?

<span class="respond"/> Might these kinds of methods impose new "distortions"? What examples can you think of?

<!-- ## Marche - "Big data is coming for your books" 

Marche, (https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/literature-is-not-data-against-digital-humanities/) (This would be a good one, its general and accessible. Fun to use the hypothesis to see public comments as well)

Marche makes the sharp claim that "literature is not data". 

[I wonder if this could parallel some of the discussion of Dretske from earlier, about the mysterious process of extracting semantics from information, but perhaps here it is "literature" from data.] -->

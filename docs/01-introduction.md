# Introduction

I put forward this course because, in addition to being timely and important, I wanted to challenge myself. 

Sometimes I prefer to introduce myself as an "intellectual historian" rather than a philosopher, partly because the word "philosopher" today functions largely as an empty signifier and partly because this title captures my natural bent as a philosopher. Namely, my training in philosophy and my research is decidedly historical. My work is focused on observing the philosophical discussion of the past, observe how shift and shape, and ask question about the "causes" that direct these intellectual currents. 

But this interest has brought me to a second interests. My attempts to observe intellectual history have forced me, most especially practically rather than theoretically, with the nature of information and how we encounter it. 

The observation of history is only down the "recorded" record of history. And the how of this recording has an impact on what gets recorded, and without doubt how we access that information certainly has dramatic impact on how we understand history, and in turn record new stories. 

As I said these are questions I have encountered first and foremost practically. That is, they have not been the direct focus of philosophical reflection. Rather I have faced them in my attempts to make the historical record accessible.

So, as I graduate student I learned to read medieval manuscripts. In the process, I've seen how the expense and labor of creating these works has impacted who could read them, when they could read. In tracking, the survival of text into the present, the evidence of impact of the printing press is pervasive. But it too is "determinative", opening certain pathways while limiting others, replacing some of things loved about manuscripts with new features that will come to be loved by readers of print. 

In this pursuit, now over a decade long, I've become a digital archivists, database designer, and software developer. This has forced me even more dramatically to think about what information, abstracted from the media in which it has been recorded. This kind of abstraction is exciting. It allows me think of "information" distinct from a particular visual presentation, and allows me to imagine alternative presentations. 

The ability to quickly manipulate the presentation of data, pushes one in a philosophical direction. Where there was only way for information to appear, there was nothing to discuss. But now when a information can easily appear in multiple forms, the question naturally arises which presentation is best? In which cases and for what reason? And these raises for us a central question of this course: How does the medium affect the "message"?

So, as I said, with this course, I wanted to not only offer a course that might interest many students, I also wanted to challenge and push myself to begin thinking explicitly and philosophically about the questions I was already encountering a practical level. 

Thus, this seminar is meant to be a reading group of collaborating researchers. You are the fellow researchers. To do well in this course, you need to become interested yourself in the questions at hand by finding a way these questions connect to other themes/issues you already care about. In finding that connection, your job is to pursue an articulation of the impact of media (and its transformations) on your other area of interest. (Our assignments will push in this direction. But success will mean finding your own inner drive.) 

In preparing this course, I've focused on preparing a set of readings, exercise, and questions that can evoke a conversation that will be useful to your own exploration. But I will be a co-researcher/investigators with you. I do not have answers for you to ingest, in large because we haven't even yet found the right or pertinent questions for the topic at head.

We know that we are living through one of the greatest media shifts human history has ever experienced. There is no textbook or map for appreciating this transition because no one has ever lived through it before. 

We are living this transition first hand, thus we must turn to our own cognitive powers to organize and then assess what is happening. That is what I want to do with you.

## Two guiding questions. 

With that said, let me offer to very high level questions that shape the direction our exploration takes. 

First: 

We are not the first to recognize the impact of media shifts. Thinkers of the 20th century believed they were going an enormous shift, unaware of the fact that by comparison, transitions to radio and television would appear as a mere blip in comparison to the changes of the 21st century.

It was therefore, Marshal McLuhan, the media guru of super star status in the 1970's who argued that the "Medium is the Message". We will explore this claim in our next class. 

But in short I think he wants to point out that the medium through which we receive information/message is not an innocuous means of transport. Rather the medium effects and shapes the ultimate message we receive.

This might be as simple as saying, while on the surface, if I read Harry Potter in a bound book and you listen to it as an audio book, we DO NOT receive the same message.

Said another way, we might say that media affects our consciousness. It is not so simple as saying, we have an idea, and then we express that idea in a medium, from which the recipient then extract that message. 

McLuhan insist that medium of expression has determined or affect what consciousness thinks, and the medium of expression has determined or affect what the message the recipient extracts.

We will operate with this as a working hypothesis through the semester, to which we will be forever on the look out for confirmation or exposition of this thesis. 

Is it really true that medium affects consciousness? Where do we see evidence of this?
In what way, to what extremes does the medium affect consciousness? Where do we see evidence of these modalities and limits.

Second: 

On the assumption that the medium is the message, there is a second, more difficult, more paradoxical, perhaps unanswerable question. 

In the midst of a shift as momentous as this one, we not only want to observe the impact of media, but to use this reflection to make decisions about action. What benefits are at risk of being lost through a given media shift, what benefits are to be gained? How ought we to measure the pros against the cons, and how might this advise us going forward, when we as human choose to pursue one media form over another. 

The question is however made paradoxical by our initial hypothesis.

If the dominant medium shapes our consciousness, then how is it possible to see outside our beyond the medium environment within which live. 

If a given medium encourages certain patterns of thought, then this will develop into a norm or nature to be valued and preserved. What threatens this pattern will be seen as bad. 

In short, how we can we ever judge the pros/cons form a neutral standpoint? Won't our evaluations simply confirm what our habituation to a given medium prefers? 

Or is possible, with enough reflection and effort to peer outside the world view shaped by our dominant environment to glimpse independent and universal truths about human nature? Is it possible to see some eternal values or goods that exist apart from the world in which we live, and which can direct or guide the choices of media based on the degree to which a given medium promotes or discourages such values. 

This is an open and difficult question, but an important one. 

We simultaneously want to be keeping an eye out for the timeless values that we want to support and promote, but at the same time be constantly be aware to what degree the dominant media form is already driving our values in a particular direction. 

In short, is this something we really value, or is something we've been trained to value, but actually preventing us from seeing or experiencing alternative or even better goods. 

These are classic question for any marxist theorist, and we will attempt to find sources of guidance in this literature (we will peak in this direction in our next class.)

### Course division.

With these broad questions in mind, I focused on our course into three units.

I. A history: We will read from a historical point of view about how the notion of information of has changed over time. 
This will certainly be one confirmation of the McLuhan hypothesis: as media have changed, so has our understanding of what information is.

II. The Personal. 
While some of the pressing questions about modern media are social (dealing with freedom, privacy, property, etc), I want to look first at a more personal set of questions, namely how media shifts are changing us as individuals, and some of the most character forming activities we know of: namely the act of reading, writing, creating and consuming information.

Some have suggested, the notion of private reading only emerged in the modern period with the invention of print, giving rise to a uniquely modern preoccupation with the self. I want to explore this impact and how 21st century media are changing the nature of reading and information consumption, for good or ill.

III. Finally, I want to look at the social impact by exploring the notion of public sphere. As Habermas notes the concept of a "public sphere" and "deliberative democracy" is a uniquely modern phenomenon made possible again through a particular form of media, the printing press. 

Here we will want to explore what the public sphere is and the impact of 21st century media on it. Some of heralded the Internet as true medium of democracy while others worry about the Internet's impact of the diminishment of a genuine "public sphere". Here again, we will want to evaluate if and why a "public sphere" ought to be valued, and the degree to which 21st medium can benefit or harm the public sphere. And if both, what are the distinguishing features of digital medium prove beneficial in contrast to those that prove harmful?

### Importance of understanding the medium (even if it is hard)

Concluding note about taking an interest in technical matters. (lab assignments?? )

(Lessig end of chapter 7, indirect regulation, through manipulation of the code/architecture.)
(Also Lessig end of chapter 18)

In the end Lessig's worry about indirect regulation and lack of transparency is instance of a larger worry about technology in general. 

The worry is that while technology by definition is human made product it has the tendency to take on the appearance of nature or a God. 

(Fromm's remarks about idolatry as way to think about alienation might be important here)

The seeming complexity of modern technology in the digital age contributes to this appearance of "naturalness". 

The effect of seeing technology as natural or a God is the kind of idolatry that Fromm talks about our "alienation" that Marx talks about. 

Our human constructions take on a life of their own and, instead of serving our purposes, they begin to impose upon a kind of "pseudo-natural law", forcing us, the creators, to conform to this law, whether or not this pseudo law advances our original human purposes. 

In short, we forget that something like the internet is a human construction. 
We talk its pathways, affordances, and limitations as God given. And when these pathways and limitations seem to threaten our values, we feel helpless in the face of them. We shrug, and simply accept that this is the nature of things. 

But in reality this is not the nature of things. It only is this way because we do not have the capacity to see the "this internet" is one actualized realization of many possibilities. And if we do not like the outcomes, we have the power to change the architecture. 

But to see that we have this power requires that we take an interest in understanding the architecture. To give up on this understanding or to suggest that this understanding is not important human responsibility is to transform a human product into an alien object that governs our life.

Lessig says this very well at the end of his book, p. 338: 

> "The truth, I suspect, is tha the Declans (libertarians) will win -- at least for now. We will treat code -- based environmental disasters -- like the loss of privacy, like the censorship of censorware filters, like the disappearance of an intellectual commons -- as if they were produced by gods, not by Man. We will watch as important aspects of privacy and free speech are erased by the emerging architecture of the panopticon, and we will speak, like modern Jeffersons, about nature making it so -- forgetting that here, we are nature. We will in many domains of our social life come to see the Net as the product of something alien -- something we cannot direct because we cannot direct anything. Something instead that we must simply accept, as it invades and transforms our lives." (lessig p. 338)

Thus, I want to say that understanding the the media of communication belongs to the humanities. Historically this has always been the case. Humanists have been perpetually involved in analyzing the tools of communication, from language forms, to rhetoric and argument forms, to book culture. 

It would be therefore an abdication of our duty to refused to investigate the new media forms just because they are different and challenging. As humanist we need to be as interested in the "bit" as we are in the letter, for no other reason than because as the "bit" begins to carry the "letter", the very meaning of what a "letter" is beginning to change. And the "letter" like a hammer is a technological tool, it is not a piece of nature and it did not fall from the heavens. Thus if we as humanists want these tools to work for us, if we want to control their use rather than be controlled by them, we have to push ourselves to understand the new medium that enables them. If we do not, we will be forced to accept the rules that others create, others who have answered the challenge and were willing to investigate beyond where we were willing to go.

Some related thoughts:

One person once asked me do it really matter communicate a letter via a "bit". Isn't this just like quibbling over what kind of pen we use. How can the message be affected by the kind of pen we use. 

But if we think a little more broadly I don't think it is hard to find ways that it matters. 

If write a message with a pen and you write a message with pen and then we both type this message and print it, are there any important differences. 

Think about what surrounds the message and how that impacts the message. 

Handwriting comes with a kind of personal identity, where has the digital message does not. That's already a big difference. 

What about a different between pen and pencil. The latter message is eraseable. That's a big difference. 

A digital message, however, is re-producible, copyable in much more efficient ways than a handwritten message, and that too, will have dramatic effects, as we will see (hopefully) on things like "copy-right".

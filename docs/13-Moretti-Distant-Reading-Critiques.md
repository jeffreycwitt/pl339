Readings from Pendergast and Ascari

**Question**: What kinds of support and applications have been found for "distant reading"

**Question**: What kinds of criticisms have been raised?

Can we separate two kinds of criticism: criticism of method and criticism of execution. 

Is the critic criticizing the method has somehow fatally flawed or the criticism directed at the particular execution in this case. 

If the latter (that is directed at the execution) what are some of the difficulties that make executing hard. Does there remain a like of access to data? Would the method work, if we could really run the analysis on all data? Is the analysis limited because only a fraction of real world literature is avaiable in the new medium (as machine actionable text)? 

p. 10 Ascari critiques Moretti by to objectively situating texts within a genre. He invoke Derrida here to talk about the fuzziness and imprecision of genre.


(But might this critique be an opportunity to talk about topic modelling (as one technique of distant reading) -- something only made possible the reduction of text to information/bit/numbers. Topic modelling reveals the fuzziness of human organization, and shows us the possibility of different or more granular non-hierarchical organization; the possibilities of a second, third, fourth organization perspective).

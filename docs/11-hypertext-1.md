# Review 

Last class we focused on frustrations that digital pioneers were having with the print medium. 

In general we tried to look at ways that the medium was limiting or constraining our aspirations. 

Speaking generally, we focused on three main features

* access immediacy, selection, and curation (Bush, What is a Text (OHCO))
* interconnectivity (Bush Nelson)
* non linearity (Neslon) / Dynamic Presentation

Today I'd like to continue this discussion of looking discussion of the limiting consequences of print medium for the activity of "reading" by looking at few more articles along the same lines. 

# Hypertext reading

(Landow reconfiguring the text)

{:.question}
What categories of "hypertexts" does Landow identify (see p. 71: "before consider other kinds of hyptertexts...")

The role of "granularity" (p. 71) and "atomization" (see p. 74-75) in hypertext. 

p. 82: Landow discusses how the terms "read, write, and text" are so heavily infused with print medium, that using them in a hypertext environment inevitably distorts their meaning and creates ambiguity.

"Terms so implicated with print technology necessarily confuse unless handled with great care." (p. 82)

And then he offers two examples:

## Example 1

## Example 2

(This reading is long; could tell students to stop after the second example: stop reading at the end of the section on the middle of page 85)

In sum: Here it seems we have more examples of the "medium shaping the consciousness": changing the meanings of our words right before our eyes. (Similar to the way the "telegraph" changed the meaning of words like "send" (link back to this discussion in lesson 4))

# Unit Overview

I don't want to say much more at this point. My point here to gesture at what we want to learn about. What exactly "information", how it was discovered, and how it enables this new kind of communication is precisely what we want to learn and discuss over the next 2 or 3 weeks.

The subtitle of Glieck's text is a helpful guide to the trajectory we are going to try to trace over the next two to three weeks. 

His subtitle reads: 

> "A history, a theory, and a flood"

The subtitle to trajectory oriented around a central point. 

There is a history leading up to a moment, the birth of a specific theory, and following this birth is a flood of consequences. 

This is the trajectory we want to follow. 

1) First we want to follow a history; namely the dialectic between communication and the development of new medium to carry those messages. 

In line with the McLuhan thesis: This history of technological shifts affects consciousness eventually leading us to a new idea, the idea of "information". 

This is the "theory" that Glieck points as the turning point, and today this is sometimes called the "Informational Turn" that would have dramatic impacts on communication in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, what Glieck calls the "Flood". 

In this lesson and the next, we are going to try to follow this early history. Our goal will simply be to watch as new media emerge, and to reflect on our two large course questions: 1) how are these media shifts affecting the message; and 2) what are the pros and cons of these shifts; what new gains are made for human kind; what losses are suffered?

2) Following this, we will turn to the new "theory of information"

3) And third we will look generally at the application of this new theory

# Introduction: A quick glimpse forward.

Before jumping to the history, I think it will be helpful to pause on consider the larger problem that this history will lead to and the general nature of the solution that will be offered. Having a little sense of the destination will bring some clarity and purpose to our observation of history.

So, as stated many times our goal is to use this book to historically introduce ourself to the ways "the medium" affects the message and/or consciousness. 

We also want to see that this influence, in a kind of circular, way affects our understanding of just what the "medium" is. 

In fact that evolving understanding of the medium (is a voice, sound, ink, paper) lies at the heart of the what we today call "information theory" and philosophers sometime refer to is as the "informational turn". 

In fact Dretske in 1981 said the following: 

> ‘The higher-level accomplishments associated with intelligent life can be seen as manifestations of progressively more efficient ways of handling and coding information. Meaning, and the constellation of mental attitudes that exhibit it, are manufactured products. The raw material is information.’ (Dretske, 1981, p. vii.) (See also: Philosophy of Information 2013, p. 43)

The suggestion here is that scientific progress tracks with the development of more and more efficient ways of "encoding" or "materializing" information. 

But, as I hope we will, for a historical point of view this is like looking backward after the discovery has been made. 

From our historical march forward, we are going to see the slow discovery of the strange idea of "information" as a message-less immaterial medium.

At first glance I think this is a strange way to think about information. 

We generally think about information as tied up with "semantics" or meaning. And we generally, are able to access this "meaning" without materially encoded information (we have to hear it, see it on paper, etc). 

Perhaps another reason this is strange is because we think of the message/meaning as what is material, communicated to us through a material medium. 

But the suggestion here is that "the informational turn" is tied to the discovery of the concept of information as kind of medium on "a higher level of abstraction", at an "immaterial level". 

Strange as it may be the story to be told is that the discovery or invention of the information as a "medium" at a higher level of abstraction has proved incredibly powerful, making scientific breakthrough possible in a variety of fields as well as making possible the scale and speed of communication that we wrestle with today.

## Example 1 (maybe this example should come up organically during the course of reading)
[maybe this could be a little video]

Let's consider the text on th is page / or the blackboard; "Add 3 cups of sugar and then stir"

{:.question}
What is the message? 

{:.answer}
Well, of course, we can't express it to each other without using the medium of sound and words. 

But it is something like: "directions for backing something" whose message can be inferred from someone following those directions.

What is the medium of this message? 

Written words, chalk, chalk board.

If we want to share this message with the class in the next room, how might we do that? 

Where the message is tied to the medium, the message and the medium must be moved together. 

In this case, moving the entire chalk board would be very expensive, making the speed and scaled of transmission very slow and laborious.

We could copy that message from the chalk board to a piece of paper and the select a "courier" to pass the message to the next room. 

And this is much more economical and the way much of communication occurred for most of human history. But it is still demanding and expensive. To send a letter to China is slow and expensive process. 

But let's consider what it takes to shout that message to the other room. 

There are some advantages here. No one has to leave, no has to be sent. We can harness "traveling" power of sound waves and allow them to carry the message. 

**Question** But what is required in order to do this?

A re-encoding of the message from visual signs to aural signs. 

How is this re-encoding possible?

**Question** What is required for this re-encoding?

A mind, that understandings the semantics or meaning of the message, and then can re-encode it in a way suitable for a new medium (sound waves.)

Compared to the speed and scale of communication today this, the requirement that the semantics of a message be understood and then re-encoded is still very costly, substantially delaying the speed and scale of communication.

The informational turn coincides with the search for and discover of a medium at higher level of abstraction, than either sound or light waves, but at the level of logic or ideas. (A medium with out matter. And precisely because it is a medium with out matter, means that it can be encoded in any matter.)

(draw on board a level above sound and light, called "information")

The promise that lies within this level of abstraction is the possibility of the automatic re-encoding of of message within the requirement that the semantics of that message be understood. 

Such an abstraction provides a pathway for moving message from sound waves to light-waves, letters, and words, without any human intermediary decoding and then re-coding the message. This is possible through the discovery of "information" as its own kind of medium, that because, it is more abstract, can seamlessly move from sound to light without needing (at its level of abstraction) to be decoded, understood, and then re-coded.

Shannon, in his landmark paper, suggest the need for a concept of "information" divorced from semantics: 

> The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.
(Shannon, 1948, p. 1.)

(See PofI, 2013, p. 18)


## Example 2

(I'm not sure if this example is helpful. It could be cut.)

With this first example, you might want to object and say, wait a minute. 

The letter "a" is neither a visual nor aural symbol, its an idea with characteristics. 

The idea of "a" when encoded in visual medium has this kind of look and when encoded in the aural medium has this kind of sound. 

This objection is precisely on the right track. But hopefully, you can see that a shift in the level of abstraction has occurred. 

We abstracted from the visual "a" and the aural "a" to a common idea of "a" that does not have a material but only a logical existence. 

Now we can imagine a machine that takes light waves for input and sound waves for output. 

The question is how can it recognize an identify between "a" in light waves and "a" as a sound. What is it that is common.

The information turn answer is that it is the "information of a" that can be recognized in light and sound with requiring the semantic recognition that light pattern means "a" which is conventionally with this sound pattern "a".

And rather then providing us with answer, it again points us to the question we are looking for what is the "information of a" that allows the "message of a" to be continuously transmitted across both light and sound waves.

If we can talk about distant reading, can we also talk about distant writing. 

Today, I'd like to focus our discussion first around the two main readings for today (linked above), and then a discussion of "Prompt Engineering".

# Philosophers Response to GPT-3

The following responses were written by Philosophers in response to release of GPT-3 in 2020 (3 years before the debut of Chat GPT in 2023)

* Zimmerman, If You Can Do Things with Words, You Can Do Things With Algorithms
* Nguyen, Who Trains the Machine Artist?

The other two readings are examples of GPT written in the responses to what these philosophers wrote. I thought they were interesting and amusing. 

## Zimmerman, If You Can Do Things with Words, You Can Do Things With Algorithms

# Prompt Engineering as an act of Creative Skill

Around campus I often hear ChatGPT spoken about with a lot of fear and mistrust: i.e. as major obstacle to learning and the cultivation of a creative mind. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
First, has this been your experience? 

{:.rquestion}
Or have you seen places where it is spoken of favorably as a vehicle to open up new creative possibilities. 
</div>

Despite the fears, I think there is growing evidence that a whole new field of creative expertise is emerging around the expert use of generative of AI. 

As evidence of this, I note that just this past Friday (Feb 22, 2024) I received by email the following "Call for Papers" for the MLA (Modern Languages Association, which is premier academic society for the study of literature, creative writing, etc.). The "Call for Papers" reads as follows:

> I am organizing a special session for the MLA Convention to be held in New Orleans from 9th to 12th January 2025. Please share and apply to my CFP. The CFP titled "Prompt Engineering as Rhetoric, Literary Criticism, and Creative Writing" invites submissions that engage with how the deliberate design of prompts can serve as a critical and creative intervention in reconfiguring the relationship between AI and humans. Submit your abstract (250 words) and a short bio by Sunday, 10 March, to jongkeyong.kim@tcu.edu. If you have a link to your ChatGPT or Bing conversation or digital products that illustrate your proposal, please include the link in the abstract. To access my CFP posted on the official MLA site, click here.

> By framing prompt engineering within the contexts of rhetoric (the art of persuasion), literary criticism (the study of literature and its interpretation), and creative writing (the art of creating original compositions), the session aims to delve into the nuanced ways in which language and AI interact. **Rhetorically, prompt engineering can be seen as a form of persuasion where the prompter intends to influence the AI's "response" in a specific direction. From a literary criticism perspective, it might involve analyzing how different prompts can lead to varied interpretations or creations by the AI, akin to different readings of a text. In creative writing, prompt engineering could be about using prompts as a starting point for generating innovative and artistic content.** This CFP is an invitation to critically and creatively engage with AI, exploring how thoughtfully designed prompts can reshape our interaction with technology, opening new avenues for artistic and intellectual exploration.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
I'm interested in your own response to the above prompt, especially to the questions I bolded above.

{:.rquestion}
In general, do you see a place for AI in creative writing?

{:.rquestion}
Does AI seem like the out-sourcing of the creative writing task or a new kind of creative endeavor? How so?

{:.rquestion}
If writing with AI is a legitimate creative endeavor, how would you, as a literary critic evaluate it? What would you look for in a good finished piece? How would you evaluate the skill of the artist who uses generative AI?

</div>

As further evidence of changing attitudes toward generative AI, consider the growth of training materials devoted to Prompt Engineering. 

For example, peruse the following [https://iac.gatech.edu/featured-news/2024/02/AI-prompt-engineering-ChatGPT](https://iac.gatech.edu/featured-news/2024/02/AI-prompt-engineering-ChatGPT)


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
What advice is given for effective prompting?

{:.rquestion}
What kind of skills are needed to use generative AI well?

{:.rquestion}
What is the "C.R.E.A.T.E" framework?

{:.rquestion}
What other strategies are suggested?

{:.rquestion}
Can you imagine a job or industry in which it is a full time job to be a "prompt-engineer"? What would that look like? Are there certain industries where you think it would work well? Are there other industries where you can't imagine a place for "prompt-engineering"?

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> Is the possibility of "distant writing" an example of a "Latent Ambiguity"? 

Why would we have never previously had to ask if "writing to communicate" is a good or bad thing? 

If it is a latent ambiguity and we must now for the first time deliberate over the value of writing in many genres when no longer compelled to write by sheer necessity, how should we evaluate this development?

<span class="respond"/> If a machine can write legal briefs, sports summaries, and entertainment reports and humans are no longer needed to write such articles, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Are there distinction to be made here? Is it good if humans no longer have to do certain kinds of writing, but bad if all human generated writing stops? What are the distinguishing characteristics?

<!-- # The problem of "Canons"

Another concern for Moretti is the formation "canons" of literature and how these canons necessarily restrict our ability to appreciate literature.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> In what way does the technology/medium of the book encourage the study of literature through small canons?

<span class="respond"/> How might a shift in "media" change this dynamic?

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the trade-offs that Moretti recognize? How might the desire to see details prevent the ability to see form? How might the desire to see "form" prevent the ability to see details. How do we weigh these trade-offs.

</div>

 Moretti cites De Vany and Walls who point to the idea of a "cybercascade" (Moretti, 2000, Slaughterhouse, p. 210)

Still following De Vany and walls, Moretti describes the process of forming a canon as a filtering "feedback loop" (Moretti, 2000, "Slaughterhouse", p. 211)

A movement from a poli-centric beginning that becomes highly centralized (p. 211)

{:.question}
Why is Form important to Moretti?

{:.answer}
Moretti is eager to find a reason that accounts for an information cascade and the formation of a canon through market filtering. He sees "form" as key: (p. 37: "...my thesis here is that what makes readers like this or that book is form")

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

If we take it that a central part of what literary scholars do is ask about **form** (what form is used, how did this form change over time), influence (who influence this author), rhetorical strategies (e.g. how does an author create a particular effect?)

<span class="respond"/> How might the confinement of data to the printed page and the close reading of a cannon distort our understanding of form? What examples can you think of?

<span class="respond"/> What other kinds of distortions?

I can speak about this phenomenon from my own field and experience. The degree to which Thomas Aquinas towers over the middle ages, thoroughly distorts our view of his actual influence in the Middle Ages. Today people see Thomas Aquinas as somehow synonymous with medieval theology and philosophy, despite the fact that the Middle Ages extends for nearly a 1,000 years. But while Thomas Aquinas is certainly important, it is hard to see that by reading Aquinas one has clear understanding of what took place over those two centuries.

<!-- ## In sum: Moretti's valuation of distant reading

p. 227, consider Moretti final summary of the value of "trees" as kind of "opening up.

# Other Examples of Distant Reading

There are no doubt criticisms and concerns about Moretti's approach. But I want to look at those criticism next time.

For the moment, I want to look more generally at existing techniques that are currently used in the field.

Topic Modelling
Sentiment Analysis
Source Detecting
Form analysis

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What kinds of "distortions" imposed by a small, human-sized, canon might be overcome by these kinds of methods?

<span class="respond"/> Might these kinds of methods impose new "distortions"? What examples can you think of?

<!-- ## Marche - "Big data is coming for your books" 

Marche, (https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/literature-is-not-data-against-digital-humanities/) (This would be a good one, its general and accessible. Fun to use the hypothesis to see public comments as well)

Marche makes the sharp claim that "literature is not data". 

[I wonder if this could parallel some of the discussion of Dretske from earlier, about the mysterious process of extracting semantics from information, but perhaps here it is "literature" from data.] -->

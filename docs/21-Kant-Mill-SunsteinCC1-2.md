Readings Kant, What is Enlightenment, Mill, On Liberty, chapter 2, Sunstein Chapters 1 and 2

# Review and Intro for Unit

At this point, we've read a substantial amount from Lessig. 

The overarching goal of this reading, thus far, is to see the many ways code (understood broadly, not just computer code, but physical architecture's etc) regulate. 

Certain behavior's are limited by the costs or difficulties imposed by the medium.

Thus no positive law has ever been needed to enforce a potential value. 

But when the medium/code changes and those limits or costs are removed, new behavior occurs that may interfere with certain implicit values that were never made explicit. 

With this in the background I want to turn, as Lessig to a specific "applied applications" or "test cases" of this idea. 

Lessig does precisely this by turning to ideas of copyright, privacy, and free speech.

In each case, the goal is to show us changes in code force us to confront these issues in new ways, primarily because they create new possibilites and thus force us to make choices about values that, due to the architecture of past media, never had to be made before.

Instead of looking at all three of these issues, I want to do a more extended dive in the issue of "free speech" which as become acutely pressing in our current time. 

And for this, we will get some help from another writer, Cass Sunstein, writing about precisely the problem of free speech and the possible legal justification of new speech regulation in a world of new communications medium. 

Sunstein's position is going to push to look closer at the fundamental philosophical ideas behind self government and the role of "speech" and "media" in the actualization of that self-government. Thus he invites us to look historically at this tradition. Thus as a class, as we turn to Sunstein (as well as Lessig's chapter on free speech) on want to weave in some of the historical philosophical documents they are relying.

So today, I want to look at Sunstein's opening chapters and then begin look today and next at the founding documents of the idea of deliberative democracy, with Kant, Mill, and Habermas. 

Then I want to consider some of the reason the nascent (seemingly) un-regulated internet was hailed as a champion of deliberative democracy. 

And then we come back to Sunstein and look at some of the reasons he think the ideals of deliberative democracy and ideals of free expression paradoxically demand and kind of restraint or regulation imposed on speach. 


# Sunstein's Daily Me and the ideal of Deliberative Democracy 

**Question**: In chapter 1, what is Sunstein's concern with the emerging 21st century communications system

**Question**: In chapter 2, what are the two concepts of sovereignty that support freedom of speech/expression voiced by Homes and Brandeis respectively use to support the protection of free speech?

**Question**: Which of these does Sunstein seem to see at the better or more accurate reason for promoting freedom of expression (Brandeis)

What I want to keep in our mind as begin today and move forward is that, while Sunstein, see Brandeis has holding the better or more accurate view, at the time the Justices wrote these opinion, the difference mattered very little. Perhaps it was very perceptible. 

What we need to see here is that that for most of the history of "deliberative democracy", the pursuit of the conditions necessary for "delberation" of harmoniously aligned with the expansion of speech, consumer choice with respect to speech? 

This is where I want to begin. Namely, with the question, why? Why does the expansion of speech seem so clearly to align with the expansion of deliberation and deliberative discourse. 

As we consider this, I want to keep a close high on how the media that carry and transmit that speech are at work. How does the "code" in Lessig term's contribute or help manufacture the kinds of conditions for deliberation that Sunstein points to and we will see repeatedly recognized by the tradition of deliberative democracy. 

Without trying to look too far ahead or give too much away, I want us to keep open in the back of our minds the question of how changes in "code" might be affecting the happy (and on the surface, intuitive or obvious) harmony of increased expression and increased deliberation. Is the medium changing, in such a way that this expansion non longer automatically supports the goals of "deliberative democracy". 

This is my long term question. But we, of course, can't get to it until we spend sometime with just what "deliberative democracy is"

# Transition to Historical Texts

In the next few classes, I want to explore the tradition of deliberative democracy by looking at the key text of the englightment and trace their application into the legal tradition, particularly in the writings of Justice Brandeis. 

# Rousseau 

## Rousseau and the Social Contract / General Will

Rousseau had a very unique political ambition. One might even say a very paradoxical or even impossible ambitions. 

In his words, it was "to find a form of association wherever one gets the benefits of coordinated political action but nevertheless always remains free as before."

In other words, to goal was to find a form of association where everyone remains their own law giver, they remain autonomous. But at the same time magically it seems everyone one choose for themselves to obey the agreed upon law, and thus social cooperation and coordination would result without anyone be coerced by a foreign power. 

How this was to happen was through a special kind of agreement. Everyone would agree that whatever they choose for themselves would be permissible to everyone else. 

Such an agreement removes the incentive for self-preferential treatment and results in everyone indepently choosing the same thing. 

(Video / dividing the cake example)

The resulting agreement characterized by Rousseau as the "General Will". 

## Private vs. General Will / Real Will

But Rousseau cannot be so naive as to think that people who make such an agreement will actually behave like angels or need a coercive with the executive power to enforce rules. 

How then can he consistenly say that such people remain autonomous self law givers? 

Rousseau makes an important distinction between your private will (what Kant will a later identify as your animal inclination) and your real will what you want as a "rational being". 

Thus when you act out of self-preference and violate the law, Rousseau considers this to be a self violation of your own "real will". 

And when the government enforces this law against you -- though you may be kicking and screaming -- he considers this enforcement to be self-willed. An act in which the community "force you to be free". 

## Rousseau and the Problem of the Legislator

Freedom in this sense is not "doing whatever you want" but doing what is "rational" or what can be willed from the perspective of the general will. 

The practical challenge that a community faces is how to identify the wishes of the general will, that is the dictates of reason. 

Rousseau's expresses this difficult in his description of the required "legislator" concluding that "legislators must be gods" (or something like that. )

# Kant, What is Enlightenment

In my view, Rousseau sees the problem but is not sure how to solve it. How does a society create laws that expresses the interests of the general will rather than laws infected by the biases of private interest. 

This is the question that I believe Kant addresses when consider the question "what is enlightenment". Here he is really considering what does it take to produce an elightened society governmened by enlightened laws rather than the arbitrary whims of human prejudice. 

**Question**: So what does Kant say is the one thing needed for enlightenment?

**Question**: Very concretely and practically what would the free use of public reason look like?

What kind of media would be used? Would literally everyone be able to say anything? Would everyone be able to hear? How would "public reason" be broadcast? 

Would some voices be overheard? Would some be marginalized? 

# Kant and the Power of Dialectic

Despite possible defects, Kant is certainly fighting a culture of censure. Thus at the very least he does seem to be saying that people should be free to say critical things, mean things, even false things.

But this seems paradoxical. 

**Question**: Why would the public expression of something false contribute to the pursuit of truth and enlightenment? Wouldn't the public expression of something false help move us away from from the truth. Certainly, today the problem of "fake news" seems to be a real difficulty. So, how we could we see this free expression of what is ultimately false, wrong, even racist or hostile be considered a good thing?

[here can discuss the negative results that happen when a false or prejudicial idea remains hidden and is never exposed the light] 

The process we are describing here in specifics is in many ways captured by the general idea of "dialectic" 

[discusses dialectic]
Thesis, anthithesis, synthesis. 

**Question**: Why does a middle position / synthesis seem valuable? If not a guarantee of moving toward the truth, why does it seem to indicate a higher probability of truth?

Generally, if we assume that no one has access to a god's eye view, that everyone has a partial glimpse of the truth. That doesn't mean every glimpse is equally valuable. But even the account of an eyewitness might be improved or refined by the account of a second-hand, prejudicial account. Why? How so? What are some examples of how this might work. 

# Mill and Dewey

It is this general impulse that I think gets capture well in Mill and Dewey.

Two great defends of free speech and deliberative democracy. 

In thes passages, I think we see clearly the idea that the best remedy against a false / mistaken idea is not censureship, but MORE expression. 

**Question** Why? What reasons do Mill and Dewey give? How do they see this process of dialectic at work?

-why is open speech important, why allow freedom to say false, bad, evil things. Important to emphasize the understandable notion that if "false/bad" speech is stated openly, then it can be corrected opposed. If not stated, then it will be NOT be corrected
	- Goal is to emphasize this as the "philosophical" root of the decisions voiced by Brandeis and Homes in 1925 and 1927

# Court opinions

With this in the background let's look at the opinions of Bradeis. 

**Question** In what way does Brandeis' opinion reflect this preceding philosophical tradition.

Braindeis Gitlow vs. New York 268 US 652, 671 (1925)
See Sunstein p. 248
Brandeis Opinion Whitney v. California, 274 US 357 (1927) -
See Sunstein p. 250, and p. 56 (emphasizing, freedom of speech as needed for deliberative democracy and public duty.)

# Introduction

At this point we are going to shift our attention from the general discourse about information to some of its implications. 

In this unit, I want focus on some of the impact of the informational turn on the activities of reading and writing.

In our next unit, we will look at some of the more social consequences of the informational turn. 

Before diving into our reading I want to identify some of the general questions that can animate our discussion.

Then, as we turn to our first readings for this unity, I want to look at some of the early pioneers of networked communication. Here I want to look at some of the early criticism of the medium of the book and observe their imaginations of what might possible when information becomes machine actionable and automatically transferable from one lower level medium to another. 

# Reading as a latent ambiguities

To start then I'd like to refer to a concept that will re-occur in our reading latter on. This idea is the notion of "Latent Ambiguity"

Lessig identifies a "Latent Ambiguity" as: 

> Quote from lessig here.

The point is there are many questions of possibility and value that remain unanswered or ambiguous because the inherent limitations of existing media ruled out such possibilities. When something is not possible we rarely ask if we should or should not do it. In fact, when something is not possible, it is often hard for us to even see its possibility, and accordingly it is even harder for ask to consider whether such an impossibility should be valued. 

But as technology changes new possibilities emerge, forcing us to confront trade-offs that never before had to make a decision about. This are hidden or latent ambiguities that new technology forces us to face for the first time. 

I want to think about this concept as we consider the seemingly familiar notions of "reading" and "writing"

{:.question}
Do we know what it means to "read"? 

We use the term often as if means something specific, but if we inspect it close enough can the word "reading" mean different things, either slightly different or dramatically different.

Obviously, we read books. 

But don't we also read maps? Is this the same activity or a different activity?

We read the stars. We read signs. We read people. 

If we confine ourselves just to the medium of the book, do we find ambiguity about the word reading or have we find a precise concept?

What we confined ourselves to a novel, is there a distinct notion of reading here?

Even here it seems like, in addition to reading, I could "skim" read. And these are modalities that technology makes possible. 

Imagine a book that only allowed you to read "sentence by sentence". This might make "skim reading" difficult. 

But in the midst of a sea of meanings? 

Is there a privileged idea of "reading", an ideal picture of reading and the reader? 

Perhaps: "Deep sustained silent reading"

Question: Does anyone remember school activities called "sustained silent reading"

My question here is to what extent the medium of the booked has shaped or determined this "value". 

Or better, in the spirit of a "latent ambiguity" is there a way in which the technology necessitates this kind of reading, so that we have never been forced to explicitly identify it as a value in need of protecting.

If so, what is valuable kind of reading, to what extent is it or can it be threatened by technological shifts. 


What counter forces should be weighed against it. Are there other potential values to be achieved by allow this mode of reading to be reduced or threatened?

NOTE: presumably we will have seen this dynamic before with Ong and the transition to writing (creating the loss of memory, but a new consciousness of ideas, logic, 2nd order discourse etc.)

## Reading Before Print

It might helpful for us to think about reading before the modern era. 

Obviously people read, but the notion of silent reason was practically unknown. (perhaps text or excerpts here from "spaces between words")

The goal of reading was to read aloud so that others could here it.

So now image that a machine comes a long which can "recite" the text allowed. Now, no one needs to read, because the "end goal" of reading has been achieved by other means. 

Has there been a loss? or progress? In such a world, we might imagine that soon no one knows how to decipher the scribbles on the page because there is no need to know how to do this. 

Is this a bad or a good development.

## The invention of silent reading

Mass silent reading is a modern phenomenon, which was and as common vehicle for accomplishing the many purposes and tasks we achieve through reading (various and distinct kinds information retrieval, entertainment)


## Latent ambiguity

We might call this a "latent ambiguity" because in a world where "reading" a text was the only way to extract/communicate information, we never had to ask is this activity valuable in and of itself. And if so, what precisely is it that ought to be valued. 


## Reading After Print

If today, we read in order to obtain information, and that information can be more quickly or effectively communicated through a picture or a video, and therefore we cease to read. 

Is this a good or bad development?

## Distant reading

Is it possible that an obsession with reading physically words blocks or hinders from other kinds of "reading experiences". 

What is distant reading? What is thought to be valuable? 

(Pro and con article.) 

Question: Does the pursuit of information reception through other means threaten "silent reading" or can they be complementary

## Comparable examples: Writing

We could ask similar questions about writing.

If the goal of writing is to communicate, let's say the events of a baseball game or a legal proceedings report. (article about this possibility, or lab/demo)

If program and AI bot to effectively compose this sports report or legal report, and therefore I write less and less, is my human experience diminished somehow? Or is this comparable to the way most of no longer remember phone numbers, but few of us complain that this is a genuine loss.

The possibility of communicating via written text without ever writing was not something previously imagined, thus we never really had to take stand on the value of the pure writing act, because it was deemed necessary whether we valued it or not. But if it is no longer necessary, it forces the question of value upon us with new urgency.


In the next 8 or so class I want to explore various people writing on topics that relate to these questions. 

I want to begin in 20th century with practitioners and philosophers that express frustration with the limitations placed on the experience of reading by the medium. Here our interest is in new horizons that might be opened when information is communicated in different forms or how the experience of reading might enrichment through the expansion or revaluation of the "best kind of reading". 

So we will look and this 
1) from the prospective of computer scientists and visionaries of the coming internet (Bush, and Nelson), 
2) from literary studies and the potentials of "hypertextual reading", 
3) from the idea of distant and middle distant reading

Once we see the new possibilities, we will hopefully have laid the "latent ambiguity" bare. 

Then I want to look at some critics of new media: voices that want to defend the idea that there is something extremely valuable about the act of sustained silent deep reading, and that as a value it must be defended, when previously it did not need a defense because it was technological demanded.

And at the end I want to ask a final speculative question: whether or not new technologies is of necessity a threat or whether it can be complimentary. If it can both be threatening and complimentary, then I'm interested in defining the conditions under which new media threatens and under which new media compliments or even enriches.


# Review

Our focus has now shifted to our familiar conceptions of "reading" and "writing". 

With today's reading we want to consider two thinkers that help pioneer the idea of a networked information. These thinkers were able to raise themselves above the immediate ruling ideas of the dominant medium and raise critiques about the limitations of existing media. And they were secondly able to imagine how the digitial medium might enable new forms of reading and writing that would overcome these limitations. 


# As We May Think

primary focus, starting around p. 8?? 
	(p. 8 voder, vocoder, example of encoding voice sound in more efficient and adaptable ways, making it possible to move, save, and transport voice)

{:.question}
In general, what concerns does Bush raise about current research environments?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
In the opening pages he points how much research is lost. 

P. 3, he offers the example of Mendel and and the concept of laws of genetics lost to research because of insufficient access

p. 3 "and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential"

p. 3 "The difficult seems to be...that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record"

p. 9: we would benefit from mechanical aids to "essentially repetitive thought"

In general, he seems attentive to a certain kind of waste through repetition.

</div>

{:.question}
What are the repetitive thoughts we encounter (p. 9-10)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Obviously basic arithemtic, 

> p. 10: But "the repetitive processes of thought are not confided however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine."

In other words, the construction, recording, and recalling of data relationships is also something that machine could help up us with, but is often overlooked.

</div>

** Note ** It is worth nothing the language that Bush uses of "freeing the brain" and "relief...from laborious detailed manipulation" (see p. 11) and the general distinction between creative and repetitive tasks, stands in fairly stark contrast to Socrates concern about writing as a way of out sourcing memory. 

Bush sees this outsourcing (what McLuhan calls the "extensions of man") as a way to free the brain for "creative cognitive acts" in contradistinction from "repetitive tasks", perhaps precisely the routine of repetition that were so highly valued by a purely oral culture.

He writes: 

> p. 12: "Whenever logical processes of thought are employed--that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted groove--there is an opportunity for the machine."

But, as a side note, we also seem him complaining of an inhibitor to progress that is similar to the concern we've looked already, namely the "visual encoding of scholarly information"; (the kinds of imprecise and ambiguous redundancies that make communication slow and transmission difficult)

> p. 12 "Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They imply a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field" 

Could we say the same thing about the notation of the way we write? How we indicate headings, paragraphs, footnotes, etc?

{:.question}
Beyond the generation of information? Where does Bush see the computer as helpful

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Bush indicates the idea of "selection of data", the curation of data and organization of data. 

> p. 12, bottom: But back to the main point, the computer could be useful for the generation of data, but also the "selection of data". (see beginning of section 6, bttm of p. 14)

> p. 15, "Selection by association, rather than by indexing, may yet be mechanized"

</div>

Bush's focus here takes an interesting turn. Unlike many of the military uses forseen for the computer, namely the crunching of numbers and generation of ballistic trajectories, he imagines a feature of computing power that lies "between the lines" so to speak. 

That is imagines the computer being helpful not just in the generation of data, but the unique and novel ways that data might be connected, broken apart, and re-connected. 

This might be a useful point to introduce the concept of metadata. To make such connections, we need to keep track of data. 

This not done with eyeballs, ears, or writing, but with enough abstraction, we should see this once more as an "Information problem", keeping track of information becomes simply the task of generating information about information ad infinitum.

Bush sees this better than most and imagine what could be possible when the computer is able to manage both the data and the metadata.

{:.question}
What is the machine imagines in order to illustrate these possibilities? What is it called? How does it work?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

p. 15, top, begin description of memex machine

p. 17, top: "this is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing."
</div>


In the constructions of trails of association, what seems to be to be the remarkable things is the RE-USE of information (at a granular level, a paragraph here, a photo, a page, etc) in NEW-CONTEXTS. The construction of NEW-HIERARCHIES (new kinds of associations) from old HIERARCHIES. This strikes me at once as both a simple innovation, and a startling powerful one from the point of view research discovery.

> p. 17 "and he trails to do not fade" This also strikes me as important. In many cases, in research, we build associative trails in order to arrive at a conclusion. We then right an article and with our conclusions casting aside the trail. 

The ability to save and name the trail creates the possibility of future re-use and future-re-discovery that is often lost in scholarship. 

{:.question}
What are the limits of his vision?

{:.answer}
p. 15: The associations he seems are largely limited to the associations made by an individual researchers. He does not yet see the possibility of social connectivity as we know it today

{:.question}
Do you see any other concerns or drawbacks back with the research environment he envisions?


# Literary Machines

Let us turn now to now the pioneering thought of Ted Nelson. Nelson fascinated with Bush's ideas and, as he was writing closer to the dawn of the information age, was able to envision more possibilities and accordingly saw the limitations of print medium with more urgency. 

[youtube video]

[discussion should follow video ]

{:.question}
Question: From reading these texts, what do you see as they most fundamental frustration with the existing state of information and the communication of information?

{:answer}
[point to passages that students can quickly review]

Perhaps more than anything else, Nelson seems concerned with the "rigidity" of the linear sequence enforced by print media.

> Nelson p. 1/14: “We are used to sequential writing, and so we come easily to suppose that writing is intrinsically sequential.”

In particular: Nelson identifies two problems with sequential writing:

> Nelson. P. 1/14: “1) it spoils the unity and structure of interconnection. 2) It forces a single sequence for all readers which may be appropriate for some. 

Let's briefly consider each of these concerns.

## Concern 1: spoils the unity and structure of interconnection 

{:.question}

Are there ways that “visually encoded data” “spoils the unity and structure of interconnection”?

How does the static nature of printed text spoil this sense of interconnectedness?

{:.question}
How have printed texts tried to overcome these limitations 

{:.answer}
(cross-references, indices)

Even cross references and references are limited by space and many things are left out. 

Do cross references include bi-directional links? Usually not.

Examples of bi-directional vs. uni-directional linking 

Concrete example of digital editions, even in TEI encoding the "look" of a references and not the information, preventing bidirectional links

Consider: http://rrp.stanford.edu/MMet.shtml
and TEI http://rrp.stanford.edu/MMet.xml

all footnotes encoded in <app>, <title> <author> encoded with <I> for italics, presentational markup, and the references itself does not have a target only visual text. 

But even in a printed edition, is the text or string of text actually the information? Or the thing being pointed to. The string has just been an imprecise pointer?

The question, how can we encode this with enough precision (less entropy) to make it reliably machine actionable. 

(http://jeffreycwitt.com/slides/2018-10-17-munster1/#/14)



## Concern 2:  single sequences are not always appropriate for everyone.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
<span class="respond"/> What kinds of content often get forced into a linear sequence via "publication" through a printed medium?

<span class="respond"/> How does this single sequence distort or affect or reception of the message?

<span class="respond"/> What would it mean to be able to travel this content via multiple or varied perspectives? How might this give us new perspectives on the message?

# Nelson v Allen 1979 Interview

Listen to the following interview and then consider the following questions

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What do you make of the interviewers skepticism about the usefulness or desirability of the personal computer?

<span class="respond"/> What possibilities and use cases does he imagine? Are these uses cases determined by the dominant medium with which he is familiar?

<span class="respond"/> What makes it possible for Nelson to see outside this dominant paradigm?

Specific questions: 

<span class="respond"/> Why does the interviewer see the computer as a specific kind of machine useful for only one purpose, numbers and having nothing to do with texts or literature. Is this a familiar to understand the "universality" of information as a transmitting medium? How so? 

<span class="respond"/> Does Nelson seem to understand this better how so?

Around minute 4, Nelson talks about encounter a book in a library and being deprived on important information? 

<span class="respond"/> What information is lacking? How does this relate to his first concern the print medium destroying the "unity and structure of interconnection"

Around minute 8, the interviewer appeals the satisfactory nature of "file folders"? 

<span class="respond"/> Why does he treat this technology as sufficient while the computer technology ans "insufficient"? 

<span class="respond"/> Why does Nelson see file folders as limiting and an example of a confining "linear" or 1-dimensional sequence?

</div>

# A Concern: Limiting Metaphors 

One concern that many theorist have is not merely about the limitations that come through the print medium, but about the extent to which these limitations will needless be carried forward into the new medium. Their concern is that, without serious critical reflection, certain types of social inertia will destine us to reproduce these limitations within new the medium. Where once these limitations (such as "lack of interconnectivity" and "static linear sequence" were enforced by the logic of the medium, they are now no longer enforced by the medium but by our unwillingness to think beyond our comfort level.)

This critique is made most powerful by Ted Nelson

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yLNGUeHapA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

He also made this critique is discussion of the pioneers of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) at Xerox PARC

>"The usual story about Xerox PARC, that they were trying to make the computer understandable to the average man, was a crock. They imitated paper and familiar office machines because that was what the Xerox executives could understand. Xerox was a paper-walloping company, and all other concepts had to be ironed onto paper, like toner, to be even visible in their paper paradigm."
> .. Today’s arbitrarily constructed computer world is also based on paper simulation, or WYSIWYG. That’s where we’re stuck in the current model, where most software seems to be mapped to paper. (‘WYSIWYG’ generally means ‘What You See is What You Get’ — meaning what you get *when you print it OUT*). In other words, paper is the flat heart of most of today’s software concepts. (Nelson 1999) [TODO: find source]

Joris Van Zundert (Barely beyond the book) gives us a helpful vocabulary for voicing this complaint. 

He calls it "paradigmatic regression".

{:#i-have-previously}
> I have previously argued that social shaping of technology can lead to ‘paradigmatic regression’.8 These are acts of shaping that translate an expression of the paradigm of the new technology into an expression of a paradigm that is already known to the user. Resistance to new technologies, where the use or sophistication of the new technology is denied, can of course be a motivator of paradigmatic regression.9 Not all regressions are necessarily motivated by conservatism or resistance, however. But even when users do embrace a new technology, the act of its social shaping may create a paradigmatic regression effect. An example of this effect can often be found when a metaphor is used in a graphical user interface (GUI)." ([Zundert, p. 85]( {{ site.anno_base }}/vd6CDsznEeqgBD-VxUequg))


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/>: Why are metaphors helpful when confronting new technology?

<span class="respond"/>: How can these metaphors end up limiting our use of a new technology?

Look again at the examples given by Van Zundert on p. 86. Consider again Nelson's complaint that in creating word processing applications, we "imitated paper"...

<span class="respond"/>: ...where do you see examples of this in your own life? Where do see the metaphors of the page structuring your experience of the computer? Can you think of any ways this might limiting your imagination how you might encounter and experience this information?

# Class Project: Criteria for Evaluating an Edition

As our main assignment for this unit, I'm going to ask you to look at text editions online evaluate the success of that edition. [More on that later](12-hypertext-2#hyptertext-assignment).

But before we can do that we have to develop a rubric to identify what success means and in what contexts. 

I would like to generate this rubric as a class.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1" id="edition-rubric-discussion">

<span class="respond">What criteria should be using to judge when a "text edition" succeeds? 

<span class="respond">Is success context dependent? Does it depend on goals? 

<span class="respond">What are some goals that a digital edition might be well suited for? Why?

<span class="respond">What are some goals that a digital edition might not be well suited for? Why?

Use our annotation tool to respond. Please use the tag 'edition-rubric' so that we can group these discussions together.

Keep in mind the discussion doesn't have to start and stop here. As Nelson suggest we can move in an interconnected and non-linear fashion. So as continue to read, if you find a text passage that seems relevant to our discussion of an edition-rubric, simply annotate it and tag it as "edition-rubric". Then we can group them all together and view them in one [edition rubric discussion](add-link-here) page

# Review 

Last class we focused on frustrations that digital pioneers were having with the print medium. 

In general we tried to look at ways that the medium was limiting or constraining our aspirations. 

Speaking generally, we focused on three main features

* access immediacy, selection, and curation (Bush, What is a Text (OHCO))
* interconnectivity (Bush Nelson)
* non linearity (Neslon) / Dynamic Presentation

Today I'd like to continue this discussion of looking discussion of the limiting consequences of print medium for the activity of "reading" by looking at few more articles along the same lines.

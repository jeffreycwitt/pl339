# Review

Last time we focused on the transition from oral to literate culture, as well as the shift within literate culture from the handwritten to the print medium. 

A central goal in our observations is the way the shift in medium enabled the new possibilities for intellectual thought, but also came with trade offs. 

In this lesson, we want to begin look at the beginnings of analogous communication shifts, namely the shift to electronic communication, are communicating via wires, rather than paper or sound. 

But our goal here remains similar. We want to observe the way new technological possibilities (and there auxiliary effects on markets, commerce, and human behavior) pushed human beings to see things in new ways and recognize real concepts and ideas that were never before seen, precisely because they available media never pushed us to see them. 

More specifically, it is with the invention of the telegraph that we will see new a kind of circular and almost self-referential process: new media pushing us to ask question about what a "medium" is, and the result new conception of a "medium" given rise to drastic changes in communication and its possible modalities.

# Telegraph 

Let's consider the following video and then consider some questions together:

Prior to the telegraph our experience of messages and communication technology has involved a vast diversity of symbols and signs. This **difference** and **diversity** has seemed necessary for a communication system adequate to the complexity of the ideas, thoughts, and emotions that we want to communicate.

{:.question}
What challenge to communication does the telegraph present?

{:.answer}
Electrical pulse admits a much more restricted amount of difference, namely on or off. How can the rich variety of our mental lives be transmitted via so little difference and variation. 

The challenge forced theorist to engage in the process of **abstraction**. This an attempt to see a more general pattern standing behind complexity.

{:.question}
How did the needle system and then morse code through abstraction find a simpler pattern standing behind the more diverse English alphabet

{:.answer}
They re-imagined the alphabet, not as a picture or visual image or a sound, but a decision, made in succession.

[kahn academy code example of decision tree could go here] 

I think it is easy to see this simple as a engineer achievement, a reconfiguring of stuff that amounts to the same. But I think it is really important to see that there is more going on here. 

This abstraction is a new way of thinking about what a letter is. It is abstraction that rises above sound and image, and says a letter in actuality is neither a sound or an image, but something deeper, a logical idea, that can be illustrated in sound or image.

**Example**

[make video]
Let's think of a different example: a triangle. 

I can draw a picture of a triangle. 

But do any of us want to say that this thing I drew is a triangle. If we look closely at what I've drawn, none of the lines are perfectly straight, none of the angles are perfectly drawn. If we used this triangle as the "form" of all triangles, its imperfections would certainly destroy all geometry. 

So what then is this that I have drawn?

We might say, it is merely a visual approximation of the pure idea of a triangle that can never actually be drawn. The picture is there, not to draw my attention to, but to point my attention to the perfect idea it illustrates. 

Oddly then, even though we usually think of an image when we see a triangle, a triangle cannot be drawn and it cannot be defined by its appearance. 

What then is a triangle. An triangle is rather an 'idea' with certain characteristics and properties. (3 sides, angles that add up to 180 degrees, etc.)

<!-- end example -->

The decision of telegraph engineers to represent a letter in a new way, via needle position or morse code, required them to "abstract" from the visual appearance of letter, and think about what a letter is independent of its "material manifestation". 

And though they perhaps did not complete the thought process, they pushed us to begin thinking about letters and words and logical ideas, with a given set of properties, namely a position with a decision tree, or a statistical frequency occurring within a pre-defined set of possibilities. 

**In Sum** While this still may be confusing, let's simply mark this idea as critical and something we will return when we learn about Claude Shannon and his new idea of "information"

# Telegraph: Analogous understanding and new paradigms

[handout 01-04] - Harper's 1873, "The telegraph", esp. p. 336, discusses the kinds of new ideas that have arisen because of communicating messages via telegraph. 

Discuss the changing meaning of the words "send" and "message", with funny anecdotes.

McLuhan has example of people buying books to get them copied by a scribe.

Example of this kind of confusion happening today. 

[Becky has stories of people printing her blog.]

And whether we recognize it or not the use of analogy to help people understand computers was conscious and explicit decision of the researchers at Xerox lab in the 80s. These were developers of some of the most basic concepts of the modern "desktop" and its accompanying "user experience"

Question: What are some of the metaphors that structure or experience with a modern computer?

Directory and File

(the computer asks us to think of Directory's that are containers into which we dump files. But, of course, there actually is not such container. 

A "directory" is just another file listing other files, and there's no reason would can't have lots of directories containing the same information, creating multiple hierarchies of organization.

But that's not our experience of a paper file system,  and thus the analogy places a limit on our understanding and therefore a limit on our conception of what is possible with a computer. (I hope that we can look at this again in more detail on Thursday)

Page

Webpages
Composition pages.

Question: How many people write in page view in Microsoft word. Why do we this? Our texts don't conform to pages. In fact, pages create arbitrary breaks in our conceptual thought.

Yet I often think about my writing, its length in terms of pages. The page is actually quite foreign and yet the look of the page somehow helps me comprehend the information better.

Is a webpage a page? It's not really a page at all. It's an assemblage of resources. But we tend to treat the page not the resources on the page as the things we cite. Why? Because this was all we really could cite in our experience with printed static books. 

While there are other ways, it is hard to see (because of our familiarity with print and the analogy of the page translated to the computer) how we could cite or refer to anything on the web other than as a webpage. 

I hope I can show you some alternative examples on Wednesday and Thursday.

# Telegraph, Market, and New Ideas. 

[video about code books]
[quotations from Glieck]

It's important that when we think about the impact of a medium, we don't just think about the immediate material and technology, but also the wider contexts in which that technology is embedded, especially the kinds of economies in which operates and the kind of human behaviors that occur in that economy. 

We talk about this a little bit when considering the book and its place in the book market and the nature of publishing. 

But this dynamic impacted the telegraph as well. 

[video about telegraph market forces and development of code boosk]

{:.question}
According to the video, how do the telegraph companies charge clients

{:.answer}
Per letter

{:.question}
How do these market constraints push people/customers to engage in new kinds of behaviors

{:.answer}
they created code books, as short hand for long messages. 

{:.question}
How did telegraph companies feel about these short cuts

{:.answer}
Obviously they didn't like it, because it cut down on their profits

{:.question}
What could they do about it? Or what could they potential do about it?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
Despite not liking these short cuts, there was little they could do about as long as they continued to understand a message as composed of letters, as long as the quantity of a message was seen as directly related to the number of letters.

But of course the existence of code books proved that that this identification was wrong. The quantity of message (whatever that means) was not equal to the number of letters. 

Code books showed that the same message could be transmitted in 20 words or in just one word. 

**In sum**: the telegraph company needed a reliable/uniform way to measure how much information was being sent that was independent or abstracted from the number of letters. This would be a reliable and uniform quantity, whether a message is first written in 100 letters or 20 letters.

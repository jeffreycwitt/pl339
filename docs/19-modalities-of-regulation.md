# Review and Transition

Thus far Lessig believes he has shown us that, while the Internet was originally conceived as an "unregulable" space, the growing interest of commerce is making it obvious that the Internet will increasingly become a place of control and regulation.

When regulation becomes inevitable it is important for the public to take an interest in that regulation because regulation is a form of imposing values. The Internet will be regulated whether the public takes an interest or not. Whether the government makes laws or not. 

The real question then is, if it is not the public doing the regulating, who is it, what values are they promoting, and is the kind of Internet we want to accept. 

Further, if regulation is inevitable and the public wants to be involved, then we be clear about both the visible and hidden ways that regulation works.

The lesson in these chapters, especially chapter 7, is that if we think of regulation as something that merely occurs through direct laws. And if we do not understand the more subtle modalities through which regulation occurs, we (the public) will be unable to have a say in the nature of that resulting hidden (but powerful) regulation and the values it promote protects. 

As we will see in chapter 7, Lessig will be at pains to show that the very architecture of the internet not product of nature but the result of thousands of human decisions that reflect values and priorities. 

Thus, there are reason for everyday citizens to take an active interest in understanding how the Internet works: so that we can remain attentive to the ways our most dominant means of social communication is being regulated and have a say in the direction it takes.


# Lessig Chapter 6

There are lots of communities and "spaces" on the internet, which enables different kinds of communities, lives, and spaces to form. What Lessig refers to as Cyberspaces (p. 83). All spaces and communities to need coordinates effort through regulations. 

What is unique about these communities is *how* these cyberspaces are regulated and how that differs from the real spaces are regulated.

The point of this chapter is to offer some examples. Lessig provides many. Let's focus on the first two which are intended to mark a wide contrast; AOL and Counsel Connect

# Lessig Chapter 7

Chapter 7 focus on the ways "things" can be regulated, and takes general view, considering regulation of all manner of things, not just cyber space.

A key point made here is the insistence against (perhaps) the common or naive view is that regulation is simply through positive law.

To the uninformed eye, it appears that law takes into account a number of natural givens, and then makes adjustments through direct legal regulations.

But Lessig is at pains to point the illusion of natural given is what in many ways hides from us the power of regulation at work. There many other ways things are regulated (by private or public institutions) and there are thus many ways that governments can "indirectly" regulate besides "directly" regulating through law.

{.:question} 
On p. 123 he identifies four means of regulation.

{.:answer}
Law, market, norms, and code/architecture.

The chapter is filled with a lot of useful examples which offer evidence of the way that things like market, norms, and code/architecture might seem like "given" (which we must simply accept), but are not actually given, but the product of purposeful regulation, which in turn are the product of privileging certain values over others.

Let's look at one example he gives, and then I'll ask you to think of some of your own.

Now that we've looked at one of Lessig examples, it's your turn!

<span class="respond"> Can you identify some other examples (other than the examples provided by Lessig0, of the way market, norms, and code are there results of social/government decisions, how market, norms, and code regulate behavior, and what kind of values these regulations support

</div>


By the end of the chapter Lessig raises a concern with indirect regulation. He notes that indirect regulation has the ability of **masking responsibility**, of making regulation less transparent. This has the effect of making regulation easier to enact. 

Thus (**and I think this is the critical takeaway from this chapter**) if we are not aware that "markets, norms, and architecture" can be used as tools of regulation, we're not going to be able to recognize forces behind this regulation. Accordingly, if we're not able to recognize these modalities of regulation, we will not be ready and able to deliberate as community about the pros and cons of the various directions these regulations push us. We will be lead by these hidden regulations, rather than being in position to use them as tools toward where we (as a community) really want to go.

## An analogy: thinking about the way media regulates our encounter with the message.

The quartet of "law, market, norms, and architecture" also seems like it could be a useful of looking at the concept of "media" in a loose sense. 

If part of the task of this course is to examine how media is affecting consciousness, we're going to need to have a robust sense of media, the context/environment/economies in which media do and do not exist, and how this wider environment that comes with a media contributes to the overall impact on consciousness.

For instance we might think about the book.

A book certainly has a kind of **architecture or code**. This might be the most obvious aspect of it as a piece of technology. Thus the book as piece of technology, as piece of code, invites us think and not think in certain ways. The "page" as a unit of information is certainly one consequence. The linearity of thought might be another. The notion of authorship might be another.

But authorship might lead us to consider the book as particular piece of the book **market**. The book/publishing market controls and effects and how we encounter the book and information, which books and which information we can encounter, and the ways in which we can and cannot interact with that information.

A book is marketed as having an author. Thus, doesn't the market in some construct our notion what an author is and what isn't. Author in many cases functions as a brand. (But we have ghost writers, we have forgotten co-authors, editors, all kinds of contributors that the book and the market tend to occlude).

The marketing of a book also contributes to how we encounter the message. Who the publisher is, the cost of the book, the look of the paper, print, all add weight to the boks authority or conversely cast doubt on its authority

**Norms** also seem to effect how we receive information from books.

Lessig points to education as one of the clearest ways norms are established. And education of course can and is subject to regulation.

Â We are of course "taught" how to read. No one is born reading. How does education effect how we read?

Consider the kinds of tests we are given and the kinds of questions that these tests asks. How does this effect the "message" that we get from this "medium"?

What kind of books does education push us to read? How does this shape the norms and expectations of reading?

Laws of course can also have a direct impact, censorship, being for example the most obvious.

# Lessig Chapter 8

A central problem identified in the last chapter was that other modalities of regulation, especially code/architecture has immense power to control behavior but is also difficult to make transparent. 

Here Lessig consider one way the use of other modalities (direct laws) could help make other modalities of regulation more transparent.

**NOTE** As we think about our final assignment (namely policy proposals) this is one good example of policy proposal that you could examine more closely. 

## Open Code vs. Closed Code

Lessig has in mind here the benefits that would occur from apply social pressure in order to make source code open. 

Let's concern briefly why he thinks this would make a difference.

Why would this work?

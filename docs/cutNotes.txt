# Marx and example of life determining consciousness [could cut for time] (20/100)

Before moving on, I’d like to just try to really think about the ways in which material structures determine consciousness. 

McLuhan’s thesis in many ways seems to me as a particular application of Marx insight in the German Ideology. That counter intuitively, “life determines consciousness, rather than consciousness determining life.”

[quote 7] [pdf p. 1-2] In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting-point is consciousness taken as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness.

Let’s think about a non-text related example for a moment. 

And then let's try to think together about some ways that different communications medium shape consciousness.

Question: imaging you yourself as "able bodied" were transported to a world where everyone had "three arms and three legs" would you still experience yourself as able bodied?

[Communications Media Example]

With respect to ways media structures consciousness or ideas, often the best examples occur at media shift points and reveal themselves in ways people struggle to encounter a new media with old concepts. 

Telegraph

[handout 01-04] - Harper's 1873, "The telegraph", esp. p. 336, discusses the kinds of new ideas that have arisen because of communicating messages via telegraph. 

Discuss the changing meaning of the words "send" and "message", with funny anecdotes.

[skip] McLuhan has example of people buying books to get them copied by a scribe.

Example of this kind of confusion happening today. 

[Becky has stories of people printing her blog.]

And whether we recognize it or not the use of analogy to help people understand computers was conscious and explicit decision of the researchers at Xerox lab in the 80s. These were developers of some of the most basic concepts of the modern "desktop" and its accompanying "user experience"

Question: What are some of the metaphors that structure or experience with a modern computer?

Directory and File

(the computer asks us to think of Directory's that are containers into which we dump files. But, of course, there actually is not such container. 

A "directory" is just another file listing other files, and there's no reason would can't have lots of directories containing the same information, creating multiple hierarchies of organization.

But that's not our experience of a paper file system,  and thus the analogy places a limit on our understanding and therefore a limit on our conception of what is possible with a computer. (I hope that we can look at this again in more detail on Thursday)

Page

Webpages
Composition pages.

Question: How many people write in page view in Microsoft word. Why do we this? Our texts don't conform to pages. In fact, pages create arbitrary breaks in our conceptual thought.

Yet I often think about my writing, its length in terms of pages. The page is actually quite foreign and yet the look of the page somehow helps me comprehend the information better.

Is a webpage a page? It's not really a page at all. It's an assemblage of resources. But we tend to treat the page not the resources on the page as the things we cite. Why? Because this was all we really could cite in our experience with printed static books. 

While there are other ways, it is hard to see (because of our familiarity with print and the analogy of the page translated to the computer) how we could cite or refer to anything on the web other than as a webpage. 

I hope I can show you some alternative examples on Wednesday and Thursday.

# Problem of Escaping Ideology 

see 02b-marx-methodology-question

# Methods for escape and critical thinking

ideas for consistent method of critical thinking and evaluation. 

MacIntyre's idea of concept and proper end as required for evaluative thinking.

Virtue is the Mean. (emphasizing results conclusions that find some kind of balance or equilibrium) - this could connect well both with the idea of dialectic and later to the practical concerns over digital medium (youtube for example) leading to new forms of extremism. That is instead of oscilating between views to help people arrive at a mean, it pushes them to eitheir extreme. (See Frech developer interview in first episode of You tube podcast, who suggested this kind of back and forth algorithm which was ultimately rejected by you tube.)

Could look at the field of "virtue epistemology" here. 

See for example https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/
>"Roberts and Wood (2007: 219) characterize intellectual courage and caution as the virtues that dispose us to respond appropriately to perceived threats in our intellectual lives—courage disposing us to not be unduly intimidated, caution disposing us to not take inappropriate risks in achieving intellectual goods. For them, then, intellectual courage is analogous to Aristotelian moral courage, in that it disposes its bearer to respond well to threats, being neither too rash nor too fearful."

Here the possession of intellectual courage would lead to a kind of mean with the respect to pursuit of knowledge.

We might worry about media forms that prevent this kind of courage and prevent the achievement of this kind of mean. 

This might give us some "footing" to evaluate the positive and negatives of media forms.


-- 

Another methodology that can be integrated here is the idea of dialectic (could fore-taste of the kind of dialectic that will be important to Kant, Mill, and Habermas in the public sphere). 

Here "dialectic" could be considered be a component of intellectual virtue. Intellectula virtue would include courage to participate in dialectic.

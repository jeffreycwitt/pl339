Reading: Hardin, The Crippled Epistemology of Extremism
(something from epistemic injustice??; or virtue epistemology)

# Review

Let's begin as always with some review. 

In our last reading, we read Cass Sunstein's chapters on Polarization and Cybercascades. 

We also used the Podcast "Rabbit Hole" and example of the kind of polarization that media forms (rather than message) help contribute to it. 

The central point being that, while messages of hate and extremism have always existed, the suggest that possibilities of new media (particularly the speed, multi-nodal, and scale) are enabling new social consequences for the same old messages. 

These are consequences that society needs to grapple with. 

As we Sunstein's Chapters relied heavily on psychological studies that shown reasons why "more speech" does not always remedy "bad speech" -- which has been a guiding principle of the enlightenment and embodied in the legal thinking of people like Justice Brandeis.


# Polarization: An epistemological perspective

Today, we want to continue looking at this phenomenon. But I want to do so from a slightly different angle. Instead of looking at empirical (a posterior) studies about why "more speech" (at the kind of speed and scale that digital media enables) might produce erroneous beliefs and extremism, I want to consider it from a epistemic (a priori) point view. 

By this I mean we want to look at the way knowledge works, and from this understand why it is predictable or foreseeable that speech understand particular conditions can actually lead us away from the truth rather than towards it. 

To consider this we will use the help of a couple of contemporary articles, particularly the essay by Russel Hardin. And with the time remaining, I'd like to turn back to the podcast and consider ways that we can see these ideas about "how knowledge works" manifesting theme.

(One way to justify the Hardin article which has nothing to say specific to say about media is condition is: 
This article has purposely been chosen because it does not talk about the internet and its contribution to extremism. But what it does attempt to do is outline structures or characteristics fanaticism and the circumstances that generate. 

Our job is to identify these structures, and then consider the way new media forms might oppose or further the structures/characteristics that Hardin has identified.

# The Problem of "Fanatacism"

**Question** What problem does Hardin point with the quotation from Bentham? 

> "...Fanaticism never sleeps...
> "...it is never stopped by conscience..." 
Why
> "...it has pressed conscience into service..."
> "...Avarice, lust, and vengeance, have piety, benevolence, honour; fanaticism has nothing to oppose it. 
(An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, 1970, p. 156)

What I understand by the idea that the "Fanaticism never sleeps" is that idea that the so-called fanatic or member of fanatic group has entered into an epistemological environment that cannot be corrected (at least by the usual means). 

Every external criticism is seen, not an opposing view to be inspected a weighed, but a evidence of an external enemy and confirmation of one's correct position. 

Religion is not the only place these seems capable of occurring but it does seem to be a common one. 

Example: 

Think about the language of religion, the language of the psalms. The psalms are filled with the idea that the righteous are persecuted. They are filled with request for God to help sustain the righteous in the midst of their persecution. 

Persecution by extension becomes a kind of evidence or sign of holiness. One can confirm that they are loved by God when they are being persecuted for their beliefs. 

> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,
for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.

Without denying the genuine religious persecution takes place, it is also true that no one likes criticism, especially of one's core beliefs. Such criticism can often feel like an attack and persecution, and thus religion can be a shield against critique. Every critique is an attack, every attack is evidence of persecution, and every persecution is evidence that one is on the right path and beloved by God.

This is the kind of epistemological environment that Bentham seems to have in mind when he says "Fanaticism has nothing to oppose it."

## Hardin and Group Fanaticism

What Hardin thinks Bentham has overlooked is that this phenomenon is also a social one, and Hardin wants to delve into the "social" dimension of fanaticism precisely to help explain just why it is that a "fanatic never sleeps".

He writes: 

> Seeing the nature of a
group of fanatics may help to understand why the fanatic never sleeps.
When the fanatic is in a group of like-minded people, and especially when
the group isolates itself from others, either by separating itself or by
excluding others, that group reinfor<:es the individual's "conscience,"
indeed, reinforces the individual's beliefs, both factual and normative.
A fanatic who must live among others who do not share the fanatic's
views may finally at least nod. It is generally the group that produces and
sustains fanaticism.
Fanaticism is inherently, therefore, a sociological and not merely a
psychological matter. (p. 4)

and again: 

> Focus on the group
leads us to ask how the belief gets inculcated and maintained. The latter
focus suggests that fanaticism is less likely to be defined by its substantive
content than by the way it is socially constructed. This suggests why
Bentham's focus on religious fanatics was partly misplaced. (p. 4)

# Economic theory of knowledge

**Question**: What is the economic theory of knowledge that Hardin has in mind?

Conditions of knowledge:

>"Once discovered,
however, a bit of knowledge, X, will be counted as true to the extent it
comes from a credible authority, it fits coherently with other beliefs, it
corresponds with the world, or it once seemed to meet one of these
conditions. One's belief in the truth of X might also depend on the
rewards of counting it as true. I wish especially to address this last possibility
as applied to fanatical beliefs." p. 5

**Question**: What is the difference by the traditional philosopher's interest in epistemology and the social scientist's interest? 

> Philosophical epistemology is therefore largely about a kind of public,
not personal, knowledge. What must interest a social scientist who wishes
to explain behavior is the knowledge or beliefs of actual people. (p. 5)

An economic theory of knowledge is meant to describe, not why some theory in physics is considered "known", but why a given person would come to acknowledge or not acknowledge this theory as true. 

The field of physics may consider a theory to be known, and some advanced physicists may know the proof. 

But I am not a physicist and I don't understand the reasons the theory is true, nevertheless I may still come to regard it as true/known.

> "An economic theory of knowledge would address this question. Such a theory
would not focus on the objects of belief but on the ways people come to
hold their beliefs. By an economic theory, I mean merely a theory that
focuses on the costs and benefits of having and coming to have knowledge
or to correct what knowledge one has." p. 5

The ETK relies on three important principles. 

1. "knowledge has value as a resource and therefore it is an economic good". Because it is "a good", we generally want to get it and seek for it. It is more "useful/valuable" to know something true that believe something false. (Usually)

2. "acquisition entails costs". It has hard to get knowledge, thus the cost of obtaining it has to be balanced against the value of possessing it.

This is an interesting point with respect to media. The more technology /new media lowers barriers to access the more these acquisition costs are lowered. Thus more people might seek knowledge of less utility or value because the costs no longer outweigh the benefit.

3. There is such a thing a "happenstance knowledge"; sometimes we gain knowledge accidentally or fortuitously in the midst of other activities. Knowing your "first language" is one such example. This knowledge (because it is learned through activities we would have done any) is a "essentially without cost" (p. 6) Happenstance knowledge can also be knowledge we previously sought after for a prior purpose yesterday, which incidentally/accidentally turns out to be useful today for an entirely different kind of matter.

Hardin sees "fanatical belief" as example of "happenstance knowledge". (p. 6)

# Knowledge by authority

All of the happenstance knowledge that we rely on in this moment "is the residue of past acceptances of authoritative assertions" (p. 7)

p. 7 moral and ideological matters tend to rely on authoritative happenstance knowledge more "because the latter are not even well tested by anyone and because it would be difficult to imagine relevant tests of them".

> p. 8 "If I am in a small community with beliefs that others would think very odd, I may find those beliefs not at all odd because, after all, they are held by everyone I know. They may be merely part of the vast catalog of beliefs 
that I hold from dependence on authority"

This is relevant for the idea of polarization or the counter-intuitive idea that as the internet gets bigger, my community in a way gets smaller (here "big" and "small" is stand-in term in for diversity. This assumed connection between big and diverse is holdover for the pre-internet / social media era. In the pre-interent world, one could take it for granted that as one's community gets bigger so does the diversity of voices. This is no longer seems to be true: Thus, even if one's personalized community is very larger in number, it could still be very small. And thus Hardin's statement apples: 

# Normal Politics

p. 9, "As I will argue, a group that hives off faces its members with **epistemological constraints that may heightenn the intensity of their beliefs** in the wrongness of their nation's politics and **strengthen their motivations to do something outside politics**."

# The epistemology of extremism

p. 9 "A politically extreme view is likely to be a norm of exclusion that is **self-enforcing**,
even **self-strengthening**

# Nationalism

p. 12 Hardin points to three "oddities" attributed to "Nationalism" (from Benedict Anderson (1991:5))

p. 13: "Fanaticism is not a kind of belief; rather it is a characteristic of the way beliefs can be held, including obstinate ignorance of alterative views. Fanaticism requires exclusionary group practices for its maintenance because it requires the isolation that allows spurious beliefs to escape challenge"

This is interesting in the case of nationalism since it is "often directed a the promulgation of a universalist program, which, again, would be inclusive rather than exclusive". Hardin discusses how this tension can be held. 

Basically nationalist views "require protection against corrosive contrary knowledge". 

**Question** How do national based news systems contribute to this? How does the Hegemony of Hollywood contribute this for Americans? How does the Internet offer a chance of escaping this? How is the internet changing to prevent this possibility?

# Fanatatical Action Without Fanatical Belief. 

I like this quotation on p. 16: 
>"It follows then that I am led to my belief in X by the incentive for having it, or at least for credibly expressing it."

Here he describes an interest in idea (X) will lead one to group. Closed participation in that group can lead to the appearance of truth (through authority, consensus) of a number of related truths which support or corroborate X. 

Thus through my desire to believe X, my participation in the group provides me with the assumptions required to justify it.

p. 19: Summary statement: 

"Moreover, virtually all of our knowledge
comes from our larger society, not from our own discovery. Hence,
it is fundamentally group based in large part. Most of our knowledge
comes, however, from groups that are open and inclusive. The knowledge
of the fanatic comes from a group that is generally exclusive,"

Good example of Amish group purposely restricting exposure to outside information with quote from Amish leadership on p. 20.

Fanatical groups are intensified as moderate members leave.

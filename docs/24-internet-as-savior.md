# Review

In the past couple of weeks, we've attempted to trace a kind of trajectory beginning with Kant and the Enlightenment. 

The idea was that with Rousseau, Kant and others, I knew idea of governance was emerging, whereby the people governed themselves. 

For this not to result in Chaos Rousseau had to make a distinction between our private wills (our immediate inclinations) and our real selves represented by the General Will. 

The goal was for a society governed, not by everyone's competing whims, but by their true autonomous selves, even if they were not yet capable of knowing their own "real will". 

If the self can be divided in this way, political theorists were eager to find mechanisms that would allow the "real will" to be filtered from the capricious whims of our knee-jerk reactions. 

What was wanted was wanted was not "Direct Democracy" but "Deliberative Democracy". For this a kind of "filtering mechanism" was needed

Kant's idea was that this filtering could occur if a society allowed everyone the free use of their public reason, while they obediently continued to carry out their civic responsibilities. 

The "free of public reason" thus assumes communication possibilities and media forms that support this. 

Again, it does not good to say, everyone is free talk, when there is no language. Theoretically no one is stopping you from talking, but if the medium to communicate does not exist, then this theoretical freedom is practically useless. 

It is not surprising then, that in Habermas's history of the public sphere, the birth of the enlightenment coincides with a unique type of communications environment that thrived in late 18 and early 19th century. 

We've already talk about a bit about these media forms and the ways in which the "architecture" and "code" of these media forms contributes to the goals of "deliberation" (e.g. newspapers and letters are fast, but not too fast)

But we've also seen that Habermas and Louw see in the middle of the 20th century decisive changes to the communications landscape that are no longer compatible with the idea of a public sphere and deliberative democracy. And thus Habermas speaks of a "Neo-Feudalism" and Louw speaks of the "death of the public Sphere."

It is with this in mind that I want to turn, again moving historically, to why people saw the Internet as a such a beacon of hope for democracy; just as the media shifts of the 20th century threatened the possibility of the public sphere, these enthusiasts saw the next media shift (to the internet) and a possible savior of deliberative democracy.

## Information Revolution as Control Revolution

I think Shapiro's thesis fits well with Barlow's optimism and belief in the Internet as remedy to the problem identified by Habermas and Louw

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What passages did you find in Shapiro's first suggestion that demonstrate this optimism. Can you annotate this text with a link to an annotation on a representative passage in chapter 1?

</div>

Here's a passage I found that seemed particularly suggestive. 

{:.what-they-suggest}
> What they suggest is a potentially momentous transfer of power from large institutions to individuals. The real change set in motion by the Interent may, in fact, be a **control revolution**, a vast transformation in who governs information, experience, and resources. Increasingly, it seems that we will. <span class="citation" data-reading="MTNERR8X=>p. 10" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/xGUIqtG6EeqcbKtcLUxoYQ"/>

What Shapiro seems to identify as momentous is not the new idea of "information" or a new communications medium, but the anticipated after effect. Shapiro anticipates that consequence of the new modalities of digital information is a shift in control. 

In Habermas's narrative, this is perhaps a shift back to where control over communication was more distributed, where "we" will increasingly have control. 

There are a couple things to note here:

1. Future critics like Sunstein are a little more cautions about whether this is a net positive for democracy. To say "we" will have control sounds very democratic, but Sunstein will want to more precise about what we mean by democracy. If we are talking about deliberative democracy, does not necessarily follow that deliberative democracy is improved the more directly people are able to influence political decisions and the more distributed communications power is 

2. A second concern might come from someone like Lessig, who would remind us that there is nothing fixed about the Internet. If Shapiro's description of the Interent is accurate in 1999, does it follow that this will be the nature of the Internet today. To what extent does today's Internet still conform to the ideals of Barlow and Shapiro and to what extent and has shifted back towards something like the neo-feudalism described by Habermas.



## Personalization of Experience

In chapter 5 Shapiro champions the emerging possibility to use the internet to personalize your experience. 

From our earlier readings of Sunstein, we know that this is a source of concern, so it worth our time to first consider the positives. 

Why does Shapiro see this ability to "personalize" as a net positive and to what extent could this personalization been seen as a contribution to democratic aims.

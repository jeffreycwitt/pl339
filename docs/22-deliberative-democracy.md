# Habermas

What tension exist between liberty and equality? 

Why aren't the these the same?

Why does Locke privilege liberty over equality, what is he afraid of?

How does Rousseau attempt to overcome this concern by distinguishing between private will and real will of individuals? 

What difficulty does Rousseau's solution face? (How does one actually find the general will? How does one avoid the tyranny of the majority)

How does Fröbel attempt to overcome this difficulty? see p. 46, 48

Fröbel attempts to identify the conditions and nature of the procedure. The outcome of which one can be confident that the general will has been achieved (or approximated) as opposed to simply achieving a majority self-interested view which thus tramples and suppresses liberty.


Habermas adds to Fröbel's view
p. 57: "This dilemma turns our attention toward a relation Fröbel did not dis-cuss, that  between  formally  structured political will formation and the surrounding environment of unstructured processes of opinion formation."


Important paragraph that suggests discursive will-formation requires certain conditions: 

> Naturally, even a proceduralized “popular sovereignty” of this sortcannot operate without the support of an accommodating politicalculture,  without  the  basic  attitudes,  mediated  by  tradition  and  so-cialization, of a population accustomed to political freedom: rationalpolitical will-formation cannot occur unless a rationalized lifeworldmeets it halfway. This thesis could appear to be just one more guisefor a civic-republican ethos and its expectations of virtue that havemorally overburdened citizens since time immemorial." p. 59

It seems to follow that if those conditions are met, they must be imposed. But in this case it seems the imposition must be external, as they cannot yet be the result of the communicative power of the public will because the public will as not yet been formed/communicated. 

The above quote seems to recognize this as a possible critique. 

Still perhaps intervention could be justified as anticipatory. Conditions would be imposed that, while not, yet chose, theoretically would be chosen if the condition were in place for healthy will formation to develop.


Below Seems like a good summary of Habermas's view of a well function democracy: 
> "As we have seen, democratic proce-dures should produce rational outcomes insofar as opinion-forma-tion inside parliamentary bodies remains sensitive to the results of a surrounding  informal  opinion-formation  in  autonomous  public spheres" p. 60

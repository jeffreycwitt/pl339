# Review 

Let's begin with some review. 

The argument that Sunstein has building up to this point seems to aim at erecting a foundation upon which he can justify public influence in what to many people might appear private speech acts protected by the constitution.

Let's consider the steps of this argument.

1. As the initial and popular belief is that speech is protected absolutely, he has worked hard to show us that speech has never enjoyed absolute protection. (See chapters 7 and 8).
1. If speech is not absolutely protected, then there must be reasons/principles that determines when it is and is not protected.
    1. It has been suggested by Lessig and Sunstein that a couple of different principle could have precedent in the legal tradition, seen in the opinions of Holmes and Brandeis (See Sunstein c. 2) 
    1. Review questions: 
        1. why might this be an example of a Latent Ambiguity?
        1. what is it about the nature of previous media forms that might not have forced us to clarify principles, such that principles of Holmes and Brandeis led to the same conclusions/laws, and thus the principle question did not need to be decided. 
        1. what is it about the nature of digital media and the internet now may force us to decide the question of value?
            1. One possibility is that the limits of speed and scale inherent with print and broadcast media created "natural-like" restrictions on scale. Thus in the pursuit of a public forum that would support the principle of deliberative democracy (Brandeis), the danger was rarely too many voices, but too few. The sense that greater number and diversity should be promoted on behalf of the public interest aligned nicely with the principle of consumer choice and consumer sovereignty. The more diversity, the more voices, the more choice consumers had. 
            2. But as "media" changes the limitations of print and broadcast media no longer see operative. Costs of publication have become so low and speed has become so fast that the danger of not having enough outlets for expression is less of a threat, and it is possible that too many unregulated voices are present, now actually making the goal of deliberative democracy more difficult rather than easier.
    1. Even when the principle of consumer choice is privileged, there is still a case for restricting speech and being worried about the extreme of too much choice? Why
        1. Review Question: Why? 
        1. Because the uncontrolled use of speech does not create more choice, but less. 
        1. How so?
          1. It is possible that there might be too much speech, if is expressed all at once in the same place. If I have the right to speak or the right to choose to hear someone else speak, I obviously cannot hear or be heard if we are all shouting at the same time. Thus, in order that I might enjoy might to hear and be heard, I must be willing to allow might own right to speech to be regulated and curtailed (Classic Hobbes Political Philosophy)
          1. Regulation of radio bandwidths (the FCC) is excellent example. If we all broadcast on the same frequencies, no one will be heard. Thus, in order for anyone to be heard, our collective right to speak on the radio is regulated. 
    1. When privileging the value of deliberative democracy the calculation is similar, except there are more/different factors at play determining. The a particular kind of free exercise of speech is of critical importance to deliberative democracy, thus at times the curtailment of this freedom may be necessary so that this particular kind of freedom may be exercised. 
        1. This is again classically Hobbesian: the freedom to do everything is actually the power to do nothing. 
        1. And here we see an important but subtle valence in the different ways we use the word freedom. Freedom as lack of restraint (negative freedom) and freedom as ability (positive freedom). Two sense that easily confused and lead to fallacious and confused reasoning.
1. Sunstein take the position that speech is protected in order to make us free (as in able) to participate in deliberative democracy. Thus free expression (free as in unrestrained) works against this ideal, then it should be restrained.
1. Next he says (first line of p. 213), a communications system that is fragmented (creates fragmentation or deliberation) is a threat to the democratic ideal. Thus (based on premise 3), un-restrained freedom of expression is justified in being restrained to the degree necessary to prevent this fragmentation.

With this in mind, I think we can look at the proposals put forward in chapter 9, as an answer to the question, what kinds of regulation (restrictions/public involvement) are justified in combatting a "fragmented system of communications"

# Goals to be achieved in a communication system.

p. 213-214 he list three goals that should be pursued

1. "exposure to materials, topics, and positions that people would not have chosen in advance"
2. "a range of common experiences"
3. "attention to substantive questions...combined with range of positions on such questions" 

We could probably quibble here. But hopefully we have seen from our discussion of Kant, Mill, and Habermas (foundation thinkers of the public sphere, deliberative democracy) as well as our discussion of "virtuous thought" and the manner in which dialectic functions, why criteria like these are important for collective progress toward truth or enlightenment. 

Again, what seems unique is that for most of our history, the pursuit of these goals has generally aligned with the expansion of consumer choice. Sunstein seems to be arguing that the changes within the architecture of digital communications system this alignment can no longer be taken for granted.

# 7 Proposals

1. "deliberative domains"
2. "disclosure of relevant conduct by networks and other large producers of communications"
3. "voluntary self-regulation"
4. "economic subsidies"
5. "must-carry" policies..."
6. "the creative use of links..."
7. "opposing viewpoint..."

**Assignment** In preparation for class discussion, I'd like 7 different different pairs/threesomes to select a proposal and evaluate. 

1. What is the proposal?
2. Which of the modalities identified by Lessig does it employ (may be more than one, if so how are they combined and balanced)?
3. Some of your own examples of how it might be applied
4. Thoughts or arguments in support of the proposal (reading charitably, why might this be a good proposal?)
5. Thoughts or arguments against the proposal (what are some concerns you have, or reasons why this proposal might not be particularly successful)

[Reports to be submitted on Moodle for all to read, prior to class discussion)

During class discussion, I would like to discuss your evalutations.

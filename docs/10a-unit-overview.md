# Introduction

At this point we are going to shift our attention from the general discourse about information to some of its implications. 

In this unit, I want focus on some of the impact of the informational turn on the activities of reading and writing.

In our next unit, we will look at some of the more social consequences of the informational turn. 

Before diving into our reading I want to identify some of the general questions that can animate our discussion.

Then, as we turn to our first readings for this unity, I want to look at some of the early pioneers of networked communication. Here I want to look at some of the early criticism of the medium of the book and observe their imaginations of what might possible when information becomes machine actionable and automatically transferable from one lower level medium to another. 

# Reading as a latent ambiguities

To start then I'd like to refer to a concept that will re-occur in our reading latter on. This idea is the notion of "Latent Ambiguity"

Lessig identifies a "Latent Ambiguity" as: 

> Quote from lessig here.

The point is there are many questions of possibility and value that remain unanswered or ambiguous because the inherent limitations of existing media ruled out such possibilities. When something is not possible we rarely ask if we should or should not do it. In fact, when something is not possible, it is often hard for us to even see its possibility, and accordingly it is even harder for ask to consider whether such an impossibility should be valued. 

But as technology changes new possibilities emerge, forcing us to confront trade-offs that never before had to make a decision about. This are hidden or latent ambiguities that new technology forces us to face for the first time. 

I want to think about this concept as we consider the seemingly familiar notions of "reading" and "writing"

{:.question}
Do we know what it means to "read"? 

We use the term often as if means something specific, but if we inspect it close enough can the word "reading" mean different things, either slightly different or dramatically different.

Obviously, we read books. 

But don't we also read maps? Is this the same activity or a different activity?

We read the stars. We read signs. We read people. 

If we confine ourselves just to the medium of the book, do we find ambiguity about the word reading or have we find a precise concept?

What we confined ourselves to a novel, is there a distinct notion of reading here?

Even here it seems like, in addition to reading, I could "skim" read. And these are modalities that technology makes possible. 

Imagine a book that only allowed you to read "sentence by sentence". This might make "skim reading" difficult. 

But in the midst of a sea of meanings? 

Is there a privileged idea of "reading", an ideal picture of reading and the reader? 

Perhaps: "Deep sustained silent reading"

Question: Does anyone remember school activities called "sustained silent reading"

My question here is to what extent the medium of the booked has shaped or determined this "value". 

Or better, in the spirit of a "latent ambiguity" is there a way in which the technology necessitates this kind of reading, so that we have never been forced to explicitly identify it as a value in need of protecting.

If so, what is valuable kind of reading, to what extent is it or can it be threatened by technological shifts. 


What counter forces should be weighed against it. Are there other potential values to be achieved by allow this mode of reading to be reduced or threatened?

NOTE: presumably we will have seen this dynamic before with Ong and the transition to writing (creating the loss of memory, but a new consciousness of ideas, logic, 2nd order discourse etc.)

## Reading Before Print

It might helpful for us to think about reading before the modern era. 

Obviously people read, but the notion of silent reason was practically unknown. (perhaps text or excerpts here from "spaces between words")

The goal of reading was to read aloud so that others could here it.

So now image that a machine comes a long which can "recite" the text allowed. Now, no one needs to read, because the "end goal" of reading has been achieved by other means. 

Has there been a loss? or progress? In such a world, we might imagine that soon no one knows how to decipher the scribbles on the page because there is no need to know how to do this. 

Is this a bad or a good development.

## The invention of silent reading

Mass silent reading is a modern phenomenon, which was and as common vehicle for accomplishing the many purposes and tasks we achieve through reading (various and distinct kinds information retrieval, entertainment)


## Latent ambiguity

We might call this a "latent ambiguity" because in a world where "reading" a text was the only way to extract/communicate information, we never had to ask is this activity valuable in and of itself. And if so, what precisely is it that ought to be valued. 


## Reading After Print

If today, we read in order to obtain information, and that information can be more quickly or effectively communicated through a picture or a video, and therefore we cease to read. 

Is this a good or bad development?

## Distant reading

Is it possible that an obsession with reading physically words blocks or hinders from other kinds of "reading experiences". 

What is distant reading? What is thought to be valuable? 

(Pro and con article.) 

Question: Does the pursuit of information reception through other means threaten "silent reading" or can they be complementary

## Comparable examples: Writing

We could ask similar questions about writing.

If the goal of writing is to communicate, let's say the events of a baseball game or a legal proceedings report. (article about this possibility, or lab/demo)

If program and AI bot to effectively compose this sports report or legal report, and therefore I write less and less, is my human experience diminished somehow? Or is this comparable to the way most of no longer remember phone numbers, but few of us complain that this is a genuine loss.

The possibility of communicating via written text without ever writing was not something previously imagined, thus we never really had to take stand on the value of the pure writing act, because it was deemed necessary whether we valued it or not. But if it is no longer necessary, it forces the question of value upon us with new urgency.


In the next 8 or so class I want to explore various people writing on topics that relate to these questions. 

I want to begin in 20th century with practitioners and philosophers that express frustration with the limitations placed on the experience of reading by the medium. Here our interest is in new horizons that might be opened when information is communicated in different forms or how the experience of reading might enrichment through the expansion or revaluation of the "best kind of reading". 

So we will look and this 
1) from the prospective of computer scientists and visionaries of the coming internet (Bush, and Nelson), 
2) from literary studies and the potentials of "hypertextual reading", 
3) from the idea of distant and middle distant reading

Once we see the new possibilities, we will hopefully have laid the "latent ambiguity" bare. 

Then I want to look at some critics of new media: voices that want to defend the idea that there is something extremely valuable about the act of sustained silent deep reading, and that as a value it must be defended, when previously it did not need a defense because it was technological demanded.

And at the end I want to ask a final speculative question: whether or not new technologies is of necessity a threat or whether it can be complimentary. If it can both be threatening and complimentary, then I'm interested in defining the conditions under which new media threatens and under which new media compliments or even enriches.

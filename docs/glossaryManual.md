# A

# D

* Downsian model. 
    * Downs 1957. See Hardin p. 8.
    * Has something to do with the idea that "most voters or the median voter must see themselves as relative losers at each election.

* Deliberative enclaves
    * See sunstein ??; 
    * Seen as positive
    * Contrast with polarization or polarized groups which are seen as negative

# E

# F 

* Fishkin deliberative polling
    * a kind of polling designed to take peoples opinion after deliberation rather than their immediate gut reaction. 
    * this stans more in line with deliberative democracy and the idea that popular opinion would not influence policy directly, but would be filtered through a process of institutional deliberation.

# G

* General Interest Intermediary: 
    * See Sunstein, p. 41

# H

* Hermeneutical Injustice 
    * See Miranda Fricker, p. 1: "hermeneutical injustice occurs at a prior stage, when a gap in collective interpretive resources puts somone at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences"
    * Seems like a useful concept to help explains the kinds of injustice might occur by an impoverished public form (either when there is not enough access to idea to form an informed/virtous belief; or too much noise (aka too much access) to form a virtuous belief).
    * This form of injustice could be as a justification from government subsidy for "speech" or more strongly regulation or restriction of speech. 
    * This is injustice imposed on the "hearer of speech" where as "testimonial injustice" would seem to be an injustice imposed on the speaker.
    * See "Testimonial Injustice"
# I

* Ideal Speech Situation
    * from Habermas, see Sunstein, p. 47

# N 

* Norm of Exclusion 
    * See Hardin p. 9

# S 

* Sinister Attribution Error 
    * Hardin, p. 11 attributes this Roderick Kramer (1994)
    * As summarized by Hardin: "When people feel that they are under scrutiny they tend to exaggerate the extent to which they are the target of attention. They therefore attribute unduly personalistic motivations to others and become increasingly distrustful of those others."

# T

* Testimonial Injustice
    * See Miranda Fricker
    * See also "hermeutical injustice"

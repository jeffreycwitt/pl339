# Review 

Last class we focused on frustrations that digital pioneers were having with the print medium. 

In general we tried to look at ways that the medium was limiting or constraining our aspirations. 

Speaking generally, we focused on three main features

* access immediacy, selection, and curation (Bush, What is a Text (OHCO))
* interconnectivity (Bush Nelson)
* non linearity (Neslon) / Dynamic Presentation

Today I'd like to continue this discussion of looking discussion of the limiting consequences of print medium for the activity of "reading" by looking at few more articles along the same lines. 

# Hypertext reading

(Landow reconfiguring the text)

{:.question}
What categories of "hypertexts" does Landow identify (see p. 71: "before consider other kinds of hyptertexts...")

The role of "granularity" (p. 71) and "atomization" (see p. 74-75) in hypertext. 

p. 82: Landow discusses how the terms "read, write, and text" are so heavily infused with print medium, that using them in a hypertext environment inevitably distorts their meaning and creates ambiguity.

"Terms so implicated with print technology necessarily confuse unless handled with great care." (p. 82)

And then he offers two examples:

## Example 1

## Example 2

(This reading is long; could tell students to stop after the second example: stop reading at the end of the section on the middle of page 85)

In sum: Here it seems we have more examples of the "medium shaping the consciousness": changing the meanings of our words right before our eyes. (Similar to the way the "telegraph" changed the meaning of words like "send" (link back to this discussion in lesson 4))


# Hypertext writing

## Roland Barthes, Foucault, and Landow on the Death of the Author.

What does Barthes mean by the "Death of the Author"?

Why do post-structuralists like Lyotard sometimes think of this a de-centering of the self (p. 127)

What does a focus on authorship (perhaps encouraged by the medium of the book) seem to "center the self"? 

Why does Lyotard (and Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida, Deleuze, p. 130) think there is something wrong or distorted about the center self? What do we miss if we see the world this way? What do we understand by seeing the self as de-centered?

[Lytoard qt on pg. 127 could be helpful here; rejects self as island, self as something that emerges from connections. 
"A person is located a nodal points...located a post". 

This article might be helpful as well: http://rjelal.com/2.2.14/152-156.pdf (discusses meaning as the product of chains of difference. Thus the meaning is constructed by reader through previous associations) Thus the readers is a kind of author here.  p. 128 bottom Levi-Strauss quote is along the same lines.

In short, these philosophers would say that a focus a stark separation between author and readers gives a false impression of our selves, what we are, and how we think of ourselves. A decentered self, helps us recognize ourselves as being constituted and dependent on our connections and relations. 

**Example** 

A good example of this in metaphysics might be whether a individual is constituted by an unchanging essence or particular set of properties. 

Another example is the identification of authority in semantic web or wikipedia. 

What the authoritative id is there some person name is correct or could the correct name emerge from practice. 

So the "entity" is distinguishable by a clustering of references.

Is wikipedia correct because wikipedia says so, or because enough people relate themselves to it positively. 

Are you "Jeff" because you are Jeff or because enough people relate to you as Jeff. With a critical mass the "name" has an effect of drawing your attention, the name "works", the name has meaning.

Landow mentions "Three Forms" of reconfiguration. 

Third form is mentioend on p. 130: "the decentered self" (But i can't find the first two forms.)
  

Good summary quote from Landow: 

> No, I make this point to remind us that, as Derrida emphasizes, the linear habits of thought associated with print technology often influence us to think in particular ways that require narrowness, decontextualization, and intel-lectual attenuation, if not downright impoverishment. Linear argument, in other words, forces one to cut off a quoted passage from other, apparently irrelevant contexts that in fact contribute to its meaning. The linearity of print also provides the passage with an illusory center whose force is intensified by such selection. (p. 132)


According to Foucault. 
How market conditions surrounding the book have contributed to a particular idea of "authorship"? (See Landow p. 139)

Landow example, p. 139 (https://hyp.is/2AmglNK7Eeq2OU-7ZPTZ9g/s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/Landow_2006_Reconfiguring_the_Author,_chapter_4.pdf) University of British Columbia refuses to consider co-authored works for promotion. (Is this an effect of thinking about authorship (and its value) in a particular way. Or are the institutions helping to construct an idea of authorship, when someone is an author and when they are not? Or is it a circular spiral.)

Landow that mentions McLuhan and Einstein who "book technology and the attitudes it supports are the institutions most responsible for maintaining exaggerated notions notions of authorial individuality. 

**Example/Illustrations**
What are some of the consequences of this "exaggeration" 

Why do we care? Exaggeration sounds negative, so what's the problem? 

Well, in privileging some activities others might be devalued, while the privileged activity might be taken to a privileged extreme. 

Consider for example the citation rates for publications academia and especially in the humanities. 

(add citation statistics here.)

It seems the book technologies that construct or perpetuate the idea of the isolated author have produced corresponding reward systems. Scholars looking to get jobs, keep jobs, and get promotions then must play into this game. 

The result is a "publishing mill" that generates at best redundancy and more likely a lot of nonsense, while devaluing other kinds of knowledge activities, perhaps more dialogical ones like teaching, dialogue, public lecturing, collaborative projects, translation, editing of primary texts, etc.

(Landow, bottom of pg. 140)
Books also create the fictional idea of "sole property" and the modern idea of "intellectual property". 

Good quotation from David Bolter

Hypertext challenges that. Is it possible to see this in the construction of our annotations on articles, many of which are technically in copyright. Our annotations are tethered to the anchored text, but our annotations are not the property of the original author, but remove the underlying article and our annotations are less powerful and meaningful. We've become co-dependent, and perhaps co-owners, something intellectual properties laws do not handle well. (We will see this issue emerge again when we read Lessig.)


## Are annotators authors?

Given the reflections of Landow, Barthes, and Foucault, we ought to self-reflect on our own use of the class annotation tool. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1" id="annotators-as-authors">

<span class="respond"> Is it possible to see an annotator as a co-author or even the main author of a text? 

<span class="respond"> Is it possible that the annotator has created a new text?

<span class="respond"> Is it possible that through annotation the once main text could come to be viewed as the annotation? 

<span class="respond"> In what are our use of tags creating new texts, possible with many authors, or no author</span>

<span class="respond">How might this change our idea of what it means to write or be a writer?

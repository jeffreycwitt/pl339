# Sample Digital Editions Review

Consider some of the reviews of digital scholarly editions written by other scholars [https://ride.i-d-e.de/](https://ride.i-d-e.de/). Before our class meeting on Monday, October 12, please try to have looked at and annotated at least one review. 

Reviews can be found by clicking on "issues" in the main menu bar and then navigating to the reviews within a given issue. Some editions are strange and are likely texts you've never heard of. But some texts might be more familiar, such as the review for [Digital Thoreau](https://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-4/digitalthoreau/) or [Jane Austin's Fiction Manuscripts](https://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-5/jane-austens-fiction-manuscripts/)

As you browse and read, try to annotate the kinds of criteria of evaluation that the reviewer uses. In the eyes of a given reviewer, what makes a digital edition strong or weak? Let's continue to use the "edition-rubric" tag to group these discussion together.

The *RIDE* journal also includes its own criteria for evaluation [https://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-version-1-1/](https://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-version-1-1/). **Please review this as well before Monday's class.** This need not be our criteria, but it is one example. We can also bring a critical eye to this criteria. Do these criteria push the "text" to exploit the new possibilities of the digital medium, or do they reinforce the printed book paradigm?

# Digital Edition Review Assignment

(**Note**: We will work through the following section in class on Monday. I will also break you into groups and give you time to work you with your partner to begin looking at various digital editions that might be good candidates for review. For now there is nothing to do here, except read the assignment description.)

## Assignment 

Our assignment for this unit is to write our own digital edition review. For this assignment you will work in pairs.

With your partner you should find an existing digital edition of interest. You can use the
[catalogue of digital editions](https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) or 
list of [digital scholarly editions](http://www.digitale-edition.de/) to see a list of several known editions. Many of these editions will be in a various states. Some will be very old, some will be incomplete. Look for an edition that seems fairly current and complete. Consider also looking for an edition of a text or author that you are already familiar with, perhaps a text you are already familiar in some print version.

<span class="respond"/> With an annotation, let me and the class know which edition you've selected, or which editions you are considering for review. 

Before you commit to writing, wait for me to reply with an "approved" for the edition you've selected. Also, no repeats, so if a group has already claimed an edition, choose another.

## Rubric

Your review should be approximately 4 pages. As I grace, I'll be looking for two key elements. 

1) I want to see you clearly identify, articulate, and justify the criteria you will use for evaluation of a digital edition. Our readings on the limitations of the printed book and the possibilities of hypertext should be relevant here. What goals do you expect from a **digital** edition? What kind of reading should a digital edition support? How does this differ from a print edition or a mere **digitized book**. In addition to our course readings, I would like to see evidence that you've consulted with a least one other secondary source. A quick search on [Google Scholar for Digital Editions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C21&q=Digital+Editions&btnG=) shows that there are many articles on this and related topics. I'd like to see you explore some of these resources.

2) After defining the criteria for evaluation, your review should then evaluate the selected edition. Using the criteria you've identified, where does this edition succeed? How might it use the possibilities of digital medium to do something new and valuable, measured by the goals of evaluation criteria? Where does it fail? To what extent does it repeat the book paradigm in digital form? How does this "paradigmatic regression" cause the edition to fail to meet the goals of your evaluation criteria.?


Additionally, your paper, though written in paris, should be a single cohesive unit. It should be well-written and free of grammatical errors.

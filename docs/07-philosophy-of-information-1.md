# Infosphere and Inforgs

Inforsphere (new understanding of world) / Inforgs (new understanding of self)

p. 30: two big changes:

> First, the boundaries between kinds of things are blurring, as we see their basic, most general nature as informational. Things of different kinds can interact, and even different kinds of interactions can be seen as fundamentally similar

> Second, the idea of a unique and irreplaceable individual object is also fading.

p. 31: top "Re-Ontologizing"

> "In these ways [give the above two changes], we are coming to see the whole world as the infosphere. Floridi calls this process re-ontologizing" (Floridi, 2011c, p. 113ff.).

# PI as "field" 

Floridi's definition of the PI field (See intro p. 32)

> "The philosophy of information (PI) is the philosophical field concerned with (a) the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its dynamics, utilization and sciences, and (b) the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems." (Floridi, 2010c, p. 46.)

First goal of PI: 

To identify what "information is" or clarify its different meanings. 

Floridi as main instigator of new field starting around 1995 (See Introduction p. 32)
Floridi sees crisis in philosophy that can be addressed by seeing information as "more foundational than the traditional categories of knowledge and existence"

Second goal (p. 32) is "innovation: to develop an information-theoretic philosophical method"

Levels of Abstraction (p. 39) "as one of the most important ways of importing information-theoretic ideas to philosophy"

Maximalist approach (everything is information) vs. minimalists (while everything may not be information; info is still important and worthy of reflection.)

# Open and Closed Questions

(useful chapter for generally thinking about how to ask good philosophical questions)
Three steps described for identifying good "open questions" 

Turing's recasting of the unanswerable question (do machine's have souls/think, into the "turing test") might be a good example of crafting a good question with clear/metrics for verifying an answer. (see p. 35)

# Layers of Abstractions
LoA language comes from branch of computer science  called "Formal Methods" (p. 36)

LoA = "collection observables" ("each with a well defined set of possible values or outcomes") (p. 37)
-- well defined set of possible outcomes seems important for classifying frequency/probability of a particular value occurring (which is important for Shannon's idea of information.)


Floridi's definition of LoA (see p. 37)
> A level of abstraction is a finite but non-empty set of observables possibly moderated by transition rules.
An observable is a typed variable with a label, that represents the name assigned by the epistemic agent to a feature of the system under consideration.
A typed variable is (i) a place-holder for an unknown or changeable referent; and (ii) a set, called its type, that consists of all the possible values that the variable may take.
A transition rule is a predicate that provides the trajectory of change of the observables inside its type. "(Floridi, 2010c, extracted from Chapter 3)

NOTE: using this concept of LoA might be useful when thinking about "markup of a text" (observing letters, observing words, observing structure, observing presentation).

The choice for particular set of observables (variables) (from the vantage point of a particular) LoA makes possible a particular kind of analysis. 

This resulting analysis is called the "model" of the system. (See p. 38)

# 1: Phaedrus: Socrates Concern with Literacy.  (20/120)

For the moment, let’s begin a transition to tomorrow discussion and try to look at one such critique and try to identify the evaluative criteria used by Socrates in his critique of the rise of “literacy” and “written language”.

To his critique we need a little background. 

Question: can anyone gives a quick summary of the main plot points of this dialogue?

The dialogue begins with Phaedrus praising the speech of Lysias, which Phaedrus turns out to possess in written form.

Socrates and Phaedrus decide to discuss it. 

Socrates is less than impressed, and makes two speeches, one that defends the thesis put forward by Lysias, and second that counters it. 

It is the second speech that I think we see some of the class Platonic categories that must function as criteria of evaluation. 

So, let's look there for a moment. 

Question: What does Socrates describe as the true desire of the soul?  (look at quotes 8-11)

Answer: the ideal forms, the one (over the many)

[quote 8] p. 13, bttm. "The rest of the souls are also longing after the upper world and they all follow, but not being strong enough they are carried round below the surface, plunging, treading on one another, each striving to be first."

[quote 9] p. 14: "The reason why the souls exhibit this exceeding eagerness to behold the plain of truth is that pasturage is found there, which is suited to the highest part of the soul; and the wing on which the soul soars is nourished with this. And there is a law of Destiny, that the soul which attains any vision of truth in company with a god is preserved from harm until the next period, and if attaining always is always unharmed."
	
[quote 10] p 14: "The soul of a man may pass into the life of a beast, or from the beast return again into the man. But the soul which has never seen the truth will not pass into the human form. For a man must have intelligence of universals, and be able to proceed from the many particulars of sense to one conception of reason;-this is the recollection of those things which our soul once saw while following God-when regardless of that which we now call being she raised her head up towards the true being. And therefore the mind of the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is always, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to those things in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He is. And he who employs aright these memories is ever being initiated into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect. But, as he forgets earthly interests and is rapt in the divine, the vulgar deem him mad, and rebuke him; they do not see that he is inspired."

Question: How does Socrates describe the present human problem? 

Answer, soul have fallen and are dragged away in a variety of different ways. 

[quote 11] p. 14: "But when she is unable to follow, and fails to behold the truth, and through some ill-hap sinks beneath the double load of forgetfulness and vice, and her wings fall from her and she drops to the ground."

For me the criteria of a unitary knowledge of forms, rather than knowledge of distributed multiplicity has a lot to do with Socrates ultimate preference for the oral medium over the literary medium. But will come to that in a moment.

Rhetoric then becomes a discussion, both false rhetoric/sophistry and true healing rhetoric. 

Question: Why is rhetoric like medicine? 

[quote 12] p. 29: Why, because medicine has to define the nature of the body and rhetoric of the soul-if we would proceed, not empirically but scientifically, in the one case to impart health and strength by giving medicine and food in the other to implant the conviction or virtue which you desire, by the right application of words and training.

Question: What are the three criteria of true rhetoric as described by Socrates?

p. 28-30. 

Three things: 1) knowledge of the soul, 

[quote 13] p. 29:  Then clearly, Thrasymachus or anyone else who teaches rhetoric in earnest will give an exact description of the nature of the soul; which will enable us to see whether she be single and same, or, like the body, multiform. That is what we should call showing the nature of the soul.

2) knowledge of the different kinds of speeches/oratory 

[quote 14] p. 30: He will explain, secondly, the mode in which she acts or is acted upon

3) he can provide justification for how he arranges different kinds of speeches for different kinds of souls. (the speaker can respond, adjust. the spoken word is a live) [emphasize this point as tomorrow Ong will talk about the importance of the written text as "dead"]

[quote 15] p. 30 "Thirdly, having classified men and speeches, and their kinds and affections, and adapted them to one another, he will tell the reasons of his arrangement, and show why one soul is persuaded by a particular form of argument, and another not."

So finally, we come to it: why is writing an inferior form of rhetoric. 

Oratory, adjusts to its patient: 

[quote 16] p. 30 "Oratory is the art of enchanting the soul, and therefore he who would be an orator has to learn the differences of human souls-they are so many and of such a nature, and from them come the differences between man and man. Having proceeded thus far in his analysis, he will next divide speeches into their different classes: "Such and such persons," he will say, are affected by this or that kind of speech in this or that way," and he will tell you why."

1) appearance of knowledge
2) reminiscence instead of memory
3) a writing cannot defend itself or adapt to different kinds of souls

[quote 17] p. 33 "I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves."

Question: What do we think about this?
 
We have grown up in a literary culture. We have grown up in a world where the written word has dominated the oral?

Do we think Socrates is correct?
Is there some defect to our reliance on the world of books? 
Is there something Socrates is missing?
Do we agree with Socrates goals or do we think there are purposes for books that he has not recognized?

# My thoughts: 

1) deep vs. shallow [write on board]

Certainly, I think there are some losses by the shift. People in oral cultures used to be able to remember "a lot". 

But of course, this "a lot" is relative. They could remember a lot, but no one can memorize the sum of what became available for "look up" through the shift to a literary culture. 

Socrates's ethical orientation toward the single and unitary forms suggest to me a reason why he not care as much about these perceived advantages of literary culture. 

A reference book about every kind of tiger or every kind of plant, might be perceived by Socrates as somewhat useless given his goals. 

If the goal is to transcend from the form of a tiger, to an animal, to the something still higher, then empirical reference of only a few tigers might seem necessary. Certainly, an exhaustive category of every instances is irrelevant knowledge. The goal for Socrates is not to know every tiger, but to find the form of tiger. 

Thus, oral culture might be one that seen as providing us closer and closer, deeper and deeper knowledge of the singular forms, while literary culture might seem to Socrates to exchange this intimate knowledge for a more distributed, shallow knowledge of what is ultimate irrelevant. 

I use the word "shallow" here purposively as a kind of pointer toward repeated critiques of each media shift. Not just of the shift to literary culture, but as we will see on Friday is the theme of Nicholas Carr's critique our shift toward the "encountering" of literary culture in a electronic form. 

2). Dynamism [write on board]

I'd also like to draw your attention to the value Socrates places on the "dynamism" of the spoken word. 

The ability to adjust, flex, and re-presentation of the same essential information is described by Socrates as an example of the spoken word. 

I want to mark this and compare it to Ong's description of the "advantages" of the written word. 

But the re-appearance of the dynamism of the presented information will again be described by some as an advantage of the new digital medium (wednesday and thursday) and will by others be the substance of its critique (Carr on Friday)

# II.  The Rise of Literacy and its Effect on Consciousness (30/35) (Readings from Ong and Carr)

A. Ong's Thesis (core of reading p. 78-96, 101-103)

In his introduction, Ong writes: 

[quote 1] p. 14-15: "Oral cultures indeed produce powerful and beautiful verbal performances of high artistic and human worth, which are no longer even possible once writing has taken possession of the psyche. Nevertheless, without writing, human consciousness cannot achieve its fuller potentials, cannot produce other beautiful and powerful creations…"

[quote 2] p. 78: "More than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness."

Let's look at the opening claim in chapter 4. 

Question: p. 78 What is the chief characteristic he notes about writing? Did we see a recognition of this characteristic in Plato's text?

Answer: The written text is divorced from their author. 

[quote 3] p. 78: "Writing establishes a context free language or 'autonomous' discourse"

Question: Why are written texts inherently more threatening, then? Why are they burned?

They can't be corrected. They can't be clarified. They author no longer speaks. They stand alone and continue to shout their message no matter how true or untrue it is.

Question: Do we see something of this concern with the proliferation of fake-news online? Is this perhaps more troublesome? 

Answer: It's harder to burn, because it re-produces itself more easily, and its perhaps even more context-less, reducing itself to sound points and asserts easily detached from argument, evidence, or context.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

This context-less, un-responsive text is, according to Ong, frequently associated with death. 

The spoken word is alive, but the written word is dead.

Question: Ong acknowledges this, but also thinks there is a paradox hidden within this truth. 

[quote 4] p. 81: "the deadness of the text, its removal from the living human lifeworld, its rigid visual fixity, assures its endurance its potential for being resurrected into limitless living contexts by a potentially infinite number of living readers"

It is precisely the deadness of this text that makes it possible for its entrance into a plurality of new contexts.

[important] This is a theme I think we're going to return to often this week, and we need to mark it constantly evaluate the trade-offs. 

This theme is the tendency of the of media shifts toward "abstraction" and "de-coupling". This abstraction or de-coupling continually tries to divorce a message or information from a more confining encoded material context. 

And though there might be much to lament in this de-contextualization, at the same time, this de-contextualization makes it possible for a persistent and recognizable identity (perhaps an Idea or Form) to appear again in a plurality of new contexts. 

This reappearance or resurrection is typically recognized as extremely attractive and part of the argument in favor of each new media shift.

It seems that Ong is headed in this direction, saying: the possibility of the resurrection or re-appearance of a core message has been critical essential part of enabling scientific and cultural process.

This point seems to me to come across pretty clear in the final paragraph on p. 82: 
[quote 5] "To say writing is artificial is not to condemn it but to praise it. Like other artificial creations and indeed more than any other, it is utterly invaluable and indeed essential for the realization of fuller, interior, human potentials. Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word. Such transformations can be uplifting. Writing heights consciousness. Alienation from a natural milieu can be good for us and indeed is in many ways essential for a full human life. To live and to understand fully, we need not only proximity but also distance. This writing provides for consciousness as nothing else does."

B. Examples / Evidence 

So, I think it might be helpful if we quickly consider some examples. 

1) Example Development of Phonetic Alphabet

Ong spends some time talking about the development of the Phoentic Alphabet. 

Question: Why is a this a new kind of abstraction in comparison to other early writing systems. 

Question: What were the competing writing systems: "Pictographic"?

Question: How is the phonetic system "more abstract"?

The symbols have no "natural similitude" to the signified. 
Alone they signify nothing. 

Question: How was this different than pictographic writing? What were some of the advantages?

It reduced the number of symbols to a manageable size. 

p. 87: "All pictographic systems...require a dismaying number of symbols..."

It facilitated the reproduction of the spoken word in new contexts

p. 90: "This Greek achievement in abstractly analyzing the elusive word of sound into visual equivalents both presages and implemented their further analytic exploits"

Question: Why weren't pictographics able to facilitate this reproduction of the spoken word?

- Pictographs by-pass the intermediary step of the spoken word and point directly to the signified. 
- Phonetic words provide instructions on the vocal utterance of a word as a thing standing apart from the ultimately signified. 
[draw this difference on board]

Question: How does the creation of the phonetic word change our consciousness?

The word itself, as word, becomes a focus of study and examination.

In the pictographic world and the spoken word both point to external reality in two different ways. They are vehicles to the ultimately signified. 

In the phenetic system, the written word, points to "a word" as a kind of thing, an entity, that has meaning and reality. It becomes possible to think about and to discuss the word "apple" for example independently of any concern or consideration for an apple somewhere in the world. 

[conclude with Ong quote]
[6] p. 91: "The reason why the alphabet was invented so late…For the alphabet operates more directly on sound as sound than the other scripts…
	Sounds, as has earlier been explained, exists only when it is going out of existence…The alphabet implies that matters are otherwise, that a word is a thing not an event...a picture, say, of a bird does not reduce sound to space, for it represents an object, not a word…
	...The alphabet, thought it probably derives from pictographs, has lost all connection with things as things. It represents sound itself as a thing, transforming the evanescent world of sound to the quiescent, quasi-permanent world of space"

2) Example of Logic

The suggest is that the transition to the written phonetic word, as a transition from word as event to word as thing created the possibility for second order discourse. (If not the possibility, it ensured its ability to develop at scale). These kinds of analyses would be difficult without the permanence of the word as thing.

[quote 7] Ong. p. 103 writes: "The distancing which writing effects develops a new kind of precision…"

[quote 8] Ong p. 104: writes "But written words sharpen analysis"

There is an interesting irony here that I want to point by way of connection to tomorrow (Wednesday discussion). 

Ong notes that: the removal of the word from its spoken context requires every more precision

Question: why?

Because the removal of this context removes hundreds of "communicative redundancies" that help sure the success of a transmission. 

[quote 9] p. 104: "to make yourself clear without gesture, without facial expression, without intonation, without a real hearer, you have to foresee circumspectly all possible meanings a statement may have for any possible reader in any possible situation, and you have to make your language work so as to come clear all by itself, with no existential context. The need for this exquisite circumspection makes writing the agonizing work it commonly is."

[perhaps you've experienced this through the inefficiency of email. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes to write an email to address a question that would have taken 30 seconds in conversation to result]

The ironic point, however, is that the reduction of these helpful information redundancies, forced writing to increase the precision and clarity of the core message. The effort to achieve this precision was not necessary in a spoken context because there was so much other contextual information available to help clarify the message. 

[in short, the while same message was being communicated, this new precision allowed that message to be communicated with more accuracy and therefore needed less contextual information]

This new kind of precision, the persistence of the word as a thing rather than event created the possibility of new kinds of thought, new kinds of second-order discourses, and new forms of human consciousness.

Question: can we think of examples? Areas of inquiry that would have been profoundly more difficult or perhaps impossible without the concept of the word as thing and the phonetic alphabet.

Would the analysis of the follow reasoning have been possible without persistent, diagrammable words?

Joshua Gieck describes an Interesting example in his Book "On Information" which about some reasearch by a Russian linguistic, Aleksandr Romanovich Luria,  which I believe he learns through Ong, but I wasn't able to track down.

Handout [02-01]
Gieck, p. 39

"In the study, they asked a typical question: 

In the far North, where there is snow, all bears are white. 
Novaya Sembia is in the Far North and there is always snow there.
What color are the bears?

Typical response: 'I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others...Each locally has its own animals'

By contrast a man who has just learned to read and write responds: 'to go by your words, they should all be white"

Gieck concludes from this:

p. 39 "Literate people take for granted their own awareness of words, along with the array of word related machinery: classification, reference, definition."

Gieck's conclusion is the following: 

p. 37: "The persistence of writing made it possible to impose structure on what was known about the world and, then on what was known about knowing. As soon as one could set words down, examine them, look at them anew the next day, and consider their meaning, one became a philosopher, and the philsopher begain with a clear slate and a vast project of definition to undertake."
 
III. Print Culture and its Effect on Consciousness (30/65)

We've been talking a lot so far about the development of abstractions.

I'd like to think a little bit know about how the role of of increased abstractions within the world of print itself. 

Ong points out an important fact: 

[quote 10] p. 119: "Manuscript cultures remained largely oral-aural even in retrieval of material preserved in texts. Manuscripts were not easy to read, by later typographic standards, and what readers found in manuscripts they tended to commit at least somewhat to memory. Relocating material in a manuscript was not always easy. Memorization was encouraged..."

He points out that even in early print books, visual practices seem counter-intuitive to us. They seem to make reading more difficult not less difficult. 

[example image on p. 120] [put image on screen]

And he asks an interesting question: 

[quote 11] p. 121: "Why does the original, presumably more 'natural' procedure seem wrong to us? Because we feel the printed words before us as visual units."

It seems to me that part of the answer lies in the fact that we are the products of changes in book culture. It is NOT as simple as saying we prefer the modern book and the modern typeset book over the incunabula or 16th century printing because it is "naturally clearer or better". Rather our conscious expectation of what a book should do, what we should do with a book, etc., is itself of a product of centuries of book development…

…and therefore the modern book looks/reels more "natural" or "clearer" as a direct result of the media shaping our expectation of what kinds of activities the book should and should not promote.

This is a consciousness that the 15th or 16th century reader of the printed book did not yet have. 

Ong says something similar, p. 121: 

"Evidently, in the processing text for meaning, the sixteenth century was concentrating less on the sight of the word and more on its sound than we do."

And thus, what we are talking about here is the development of the fairly modern notion of sustained silent reading as a consequence of slow cycle shifts in a material medium.

Many people attribute the development of personal silent reading, not just to the development of print itself, but to the development of a serious of developments that led us to favor visualization of the printed text in certain ways. 

And a lot of fuss is made about the way the printing press and developments in typography situate words more firmly within visual "space" than ever before.

Not just metaphorically, but literally words are printed strategically within the context of whitespace and that localization is rich with implicit meaning; meaning that we instinctively interpret and "de-code" but rarely ever thematize.

Let's look a few quotations from Carr who describes this process and specifically the work of Paul Saenger.

Carr quote, c. 4, p. 61: 

"It's hard for us to imagine today, but no spaces separated the words in early writing. In the books inked by scribes, words ran together without any break across every line on every page, in what's now referred to as scriptura continua. The lack of wrd separation reflected language's origins in speech. When we talk, we don't insert pauses between each word--long stretches of syllables flow unbroken from our lips. It would never have crossed the minds of the first writers to put blank spaces between words. They were simply transcribing speech, writing what their told them to write. 

p. 61: "The lack of word separation, combined with the absence of word order conventions, placed an "extra cognitive burden on ancient readers, explains Paul Saenger in Space between Words, his history of the scribal book. … 

p. 61-62: "The slow, cognitively intensive parsing of a text made the reading of books laborious. It was also the reason no one, other than the odd case like Ambrose, read silently…"

p. 63: "The placing of spaces between words alleviated the cognitive strain involved in deciphering text, making it possible for people to read quickly, silently, and with greater comprehension. Such fluency had to be learned. It required complex changes in the circuitry of the brain… What we today call "deep-reading" becomes possible. By "altering the neurophysiological process of reading," word separation "freed the intellectual faculties of the reader," Saenger writes: "even readers of modest intellectual capacity could read more swiftly, and they could understand an increasing number of inherently more difficult texts."

p. 63: "Readers didn't just become more efficient. They also became more attentive. To read a long book silently required to an ability to concentrate over a long period of time, to "lose oneself" in the pages of a book, as we now say…"

Discussion - can we pause here for a moment. 

Question: What do we think of this? Does this align with your experience? Are there books and layouts that make it possible(impossible) for you to "think in different ways"?

What are some examples?

Bibliographers refer to the subtle clues of a book layout as the "Bibliographic Codes" and we need to be attentive to how this code is "encoded" visually.

Here might think of something like a parallel, to the contextual information in oral culture that makes possible the successful transmission of a message. The vast amount of visual clues within a book layout are part of enormous collection of "informational redundancies" that humans use to correctly parse and categorize the communicated message.

[Visual Encoding Exercise] [handouts 02-02, 02-03, 02-04] (30/95)

So, here instead of continuing to babble, I'd like to do an exercise. 

I'd like to try to thematize the "visual enccoding" of the printed book and identify the amount of different types of information are present in a text and to identify how they are "encoded".

To facilitate this exercise, I think it helpful to introduce a few distinctions or technical terms. 

What we are saying here is that printed books are secretly filled with "data" about "data". But this metadata is much a part of the book medium itself and part of accustomed way we encounter information and it fades into the background. We see it, use it, and interpret it constantly to get access to the message. But in our eagerness to arrive at the message, we rarely thematize it. 

For example, the text of heading and the text of paragraph are both data, but we instinctively know that the "heading data" should be read differently than that "paragraph data. 

Our awareness that a particular string function in special way shows our awareness that this string of data belongs to a particular class or type of data. We sometimes call these "data-types".

Further, there are "relationships" asserted between the heading and the paragraph or division to which this heading is a heading. The kind of "relationship" is another kind of data type and each specific relationship is the data communicated.

How do we recognize this? Where do we get this information? How does the printed text communicate this?

So, with the example texts here, I'd like us to draw boxes around distinct data types, and give that data type a name, and I'd like us to draw lines, to indicate relationships, and to classify the kinds of relationships that are present. 

•	How many datatypes are communicated?
•	How are these data types "visually encoded"? 
•	What are the context clues that indicate this?
•	How many context clues are required to ensure that this information is transmitted?
•	Where is the data type unclear ambiguous, where is a guess required? What context information is being used to facilitate this guess?

IV. Social and Political World of the Print Medium (25/120)

Finally, I wonder if we could end with just one more example of how medium shapes consciousness, again, specifically thinking about the way the printed book as a medium is shaping understanding of fundamental concepts. 

But in this case, I'd like to think step back from the book as hand-written or printed and think about the book as an artifact in a social-economy. 

McLuhan's thesis implies that appreciating a "medium" is a vast system. Therefore, understanding the book medium is more than just a physical book on a desk, but the entire productive system in which makes a book possible. So, this mean the system that

In particular, I'd like to ask you about our modern understanding of this word "published" and how the specific medium of the printed requires us to make something "public" has shaped and determined our understanding of what it means to "publish" something or to make something "public".

Question: So, let me ask you: What does it mean for something to be "published" and to what degree does that align or not align with "making something public"?

Discussion

Our discussion, I think shows that we recognize several distinct and separable functions that have previously constituted what it means to publish something, in which the task of making something accessible to the public is only one small part. 

In other words, today it is possible to conceive of making something public separable from all these other functions. 

But it is possible, that prior to the digital revolution, for example, this was not possible. And the notions of publication and "to make publicly accessible" were not able to be seen as separable?

In a world, where it is only possible to distribute information via printed copies of a text and a printing machine was expensive and typeset was laborious, a printer had to be assured of the quality, which really means the "marketability" of the text. 

The ability to make public was economically tied to the ability to sell, to recoup expenses.

To make something publicly accessible in mass was necessarily tied to a prior step of curation and gate-keeping. 

And we end with the following kind of law or axiom as direct result of the available means of production:

"What has not been reviewed, cannot been seen and cannot be accessed"

What interests me, is the degree to which this maxim is no longer required for technological reasons, no longer required by the means of production, but continued by the lingering form of social interaction. 

[marx language] (At times of shift, Marx speaks of a contradiction between the new means of productions and the old modes of social interaction. I think we are seeing something similar here.)

That is, to what degree do we continue to allow review and gatekeeping to function as determination of what can be accessed. 

Why not use quality control and review function as kind of filtering of what is already accessible? 

When the cost of making something available in mass is cheap, why shouldn't we let accessibility come first, and then review function as form filtering?

This would give us the advantage of by passing the problem of gatekeeping where and handful of people get to decide what the rest of the world gets to see and does not get to see, and would still preserve the benefits quality control as a form of curation that draw readers attention to what has been recommended as of high quality. 

In other words, the traditional economy of publication as enforced a kind of either/or. It is either reviewed/approved and therefore accessible or it is not reviewed/approved and therefore it is not accessible. 

Today, it seems like we have the possibility of a both/and. Something can be accessible independent of review and it can be reviewed and this review status can be communicated.

Our persistent with the old model seems to me the product of a particular form of consciousness that sees "publication" as one thing the present forms of media no longer require. 

Others have note this as well: 

[17] Although articles were sometimes peerreviewed, only well after the second world war was peer review introduced as a routine process for virtually all articles submitted to journals. This served various purposes, not least to limit the amount that was published, as printing and distributing journals was expensive and a judgement had to be made as to what was truly worthwhile spending scarce money on, which led to many journals selecting on criteria of perceived quality and relevance to their intended readership. The time the process took between initial submission and publication was usually quite long, sometimes very long.
With the advent of the internet, the need for print and physical distribution, and the costs associated with that, disappeared. This could have meant a complete re-think of the way science was communicated, but traditions stuck, and most of scientific communication still takes place on the old print paradigms, devised in the print era.
(https://blog.scielo.org/en/2018/05/25/communication-and-peer-review-should-be-universally-separated/#.W-FGsnr7TOR)

Let me try to show one concrete example of how this might work.

[dll peer review example]

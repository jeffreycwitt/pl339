# Review 

Last class we focused on frustrations that digital pioneers were having with the print medium. 

In general we tried to look at ways that the medium was limiting or constraining our aspirations. 

Speaking generally, we focused on three main features

* access immediacy (Bush, What is a Text (OHCO))
* interconnectivity (Bush Nelson)
* non linearity (Neslon) / Dynamic Presentation

Today I'd like to continue this discussion of looking discussion of the limiting consequences of print medium for the activity of "reading" by looking at few more articles along the same lines.

# Hypertext (selections)

# Assignment

Using the catalogue of digital, I like you to find an online "edition" of interest, find a corresponding copy in print, and write an evaluation of the digital editions. (ow does it exploit the possibilities of the new medium, does it simply recreate the old medium, how/what could it do better)

# Review and Transition

Near the opening of our class we considered different modalities that accompany different communication types.

One of those modalities was identity or anonymity. 

As our reading today suggests, the internet at its birth seemed to carry with it all kinds of new potentials (both positive and negative) because of the way it seemed to enable anonymous communication in ways never before thought possible. 

One conclusion drawn from this is that the 'internet' and communication via the internet is "unregulable". 

Lessig burden in these early chapters is to show us that this assumption of "unregulability" or "uncontrollability" is false. Soon, the Internet will, far from being "uncontrollable" it will become the most controllable communications space ever imaginable. 

The belief that the Internet is unregulable and leads to a kind of public complacency. 

Lessig wants to show us here that whether the public/government becomes involved in this regulation or not through legislation, the internet will nevertheless be regulated, namely by contrast. 

But how so, if private interests do not have the power to legislate.

Lessig wants to show us that control is being implemented through private interest, not via laws, but through the code being written which makes the internet run.

Thus (as we will see more clearly in chapters 6-8), if the public is going to have a say in the Internet we get, regular citizens, like you and me, are going to have to take an interest in how the Internet "currently works", separate that from any idea of how the internet must "necessarily work", and be willing to imagine how the Internet could "work differently" and be used to support values other than those of profit and private interest.

Our focus here (in chapters 3-4) will be to follow Lessig tour in order to see clear **how** the Internet is already being controlled by the through the participation of commercial interest.

(skip, go directly to chapter 4??)

# Internet: Uncontrollable or the Platform of Total Control?

<div class="discussion">

To begin we might ask: is anonymity a good thing or bad thing?

<span class="respond"/> How does anonymity encourage public discourse and deliberation?

<span class="respond"/> How does anonymity discourage public discourse?

</div>

Given the importance: it seems useful think about the ways non-digital communications media do and do not reveal identity, and the degree to which anonymity (or lack there of) affects the control of speech?

We might remember Judith Butler's claim that "No one 'goes for a walk' without there being something that supports a walk.

Similarly, we might say no one "speaks" without there being an "infrastructure" or "platform" to make that speech possible.

Lessig introduces the categories of "identity, authentication, authorization/certification" (p. ? ) to help us think about the ways the infrastructure affects identity, access, and control.

<div class="discussion">

<span class="respond"/> In what was is a "park" a platform that enables communication? What are the structures of "identity, authentication, authorization/certification" at work in the "Park" platform?

<span class="respond"/> What are some other examples of places that function as a communications platform? How do these platforms employ structures of "identity, authentication, authorization/certification" similarly or differently than a public park

</div>

With this in the background let's turn to the Internet.


{:.question}
Why might the Internet at first seem different from a park, especially with respect issues of identity, authentication, authorization/certification? What does this make it seem "unregulable"?

{:.question}
An important question here is whether this initial "anonymity" is somehow part of the "nature" of digital medium, such that that the Internet is of necessity anonymous. 

This is an important question because if it "necessary" then it can't be changed. But if is not "necessary" than it can be changed as the "code" changes. This really raises the stakes for who is writing the code: private interest or public interest.
 
## Anonymous Design: TCP/IP. Overview of Packets

Understanding why the Internet was first experienced as "anonymous" requeires some attention to the way the internet works

## Increasing control

But understanding that there is no natural law that says the Internet must be anonymous means that new coding decisions can change this feature of the Internet.

Let's look at some of the ways control and identity layers are being added to the Internet (and the possible pros and cons) that might occur as consequences.

### Cookies

concrete cookie How do advertisers know you across platforms.

Each site creates cookie, so that the same domain knows you on different pages within that domain.

But what about across domains?

Websites can join advertising networks.

Two website can join the same network.

Each site sets a cookie to remember "you" and passes that information (your email etc, the products you've looked at etc.) and passes that on to the advertising server.

The other website creates its own cookie and remembers. It passes its information about you to the same advertising network, meanwhile it "retrieves information about you stored by that same advertising network".

See for example: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49636/can-a-webpage-read-another-pages-cookies)

Push back with the addition of SameSite attribute (lax, strict)
https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-same-site-00

Perhaps more important than the details here is how this possibility emerges. 

Advertisers have little interest in allow user control in cookie validity. 

Thus, if this kind of control is going to be opposed or balanced, it takes people who understand that "tracking identity" is not a natural feature of the internet but the product of people with particular interest. 

If these interest do not align with the public good, then they need to be opposed. Standards groups with a pubic interest exist to influence code decisions based on a public mission. 

Here's the group that has established the SameSite cookie attribute. https://ietf.org/about/mission/? What are there values and mission? Is this standards group accountable to the public, government, private interest?

Lots of other standard groups exists (https://www.w3.org/)

# In Sum 

<!-- perhaps some concluding notes from chapter 5 -->

The central point in all of part 1 (chapter 3-5 (?)) is simply to prove that the Internet can be regulated by both commerce and government.

Further, commerce is already implementing this kind of regulation with urgency, but it is often hidden because it does not occur though publicly debated laws, but through the coding decisions of private actors. 

Lessig then asks the central question (whcih I think captures the point of the whole section):

> 77: "If commerce is going to define the emerging architectures of cyber space, isn't the role of government to ensure that those public values that are non in commerce's interest are also built into the architecture."

Why is that government and the general public have not felt as much urgency to be involved at this level? One answer stems from another central point of these chapters. 

To the uninitiated, the Internet can appear as kind of "black box" whose operations, limits, and possibilities, are not the product of human decisions or private interest but of nature.

Governments and public don't usually fight nature or necessity because we consider this to be simply the way the world works and then we navigate our lives around these fixed and immoveable laws. 

But Lessig has tried to show us that the "fixed" or "necessary" nature of Internet is is an illusion. 

The Internet could in fact work many different ways. Thus the ways in which it does and does not work are the result of value decisions made by people. Our experience of it is therefore "political", and if we want the Internet to work for the public and not against, then the public, elected officials, political activists, not just coders working for private companies, need to be involved in shaping its development.

Lessig here quotes Roberto Unger, "It's all politics" on p. 78. In short: The way the "internet" works is not an expression of nature, but an expression of our values.

The scary propositions is that if we don't get involved, then, because the "medium affects" consciousness, increasingly the way the Internet works now will begin to determine our values, rather than our values shaping the Internet.

# Review 

As we've discussed, three main categories where people have expressed an interest in the digital medium as open up new possibilities or overcoming limitations in the old medim are: 

* access immediacy (Bush, What is a Text (OHCO))
* interconnectivity (Bush Nelson)
* non linearity (Neslon) / Dynamic Presentation

Today, I want to look at a fourth category, that we might call: 

* access scale (machine assisted reading / machine action) (I'm not yet sure what the best name for this is.)

Today, we'll do this one of some writings by one pioneers of this controversial approach, Moretti, who called it "distant reading"

In our next meeting, we'll finish this up and look at some of the critiques of distant reading. 

In the following and meeting of this unit, we'll look at some more general critiques of "reading" in the new media and consider their concerns about what might be lost if traditional book reading were lost.s

# Moretti: The Problem of Studying Literature and new Challenge

{:.question}
According to Moretti in Graphs Maps and Tress-1 (2003), p. 67, what problem faces the study of literature?

{:.answer}
> It’s an idea that occurred to me some years ago, when the study of national bibliographies made
me realize what a minimal fraction of the literary field we all work
on: a canon of two hundred novels, for instance, sounds very large for
nineteenth-century Britain (and is much larger than the current one), but
is still less than one per cent of the novels that were actually published:
twenty thousand, thirty, more, no one really knows—and close reading
won’t help here, a novel a day every day of the year would take a century
or so . . . And then, a field this large cannot be understood by stitching
together separate bits of knowledge about individual cases, because it
isn’t a sum of individual cases: it’s a collective system, that should be
grasped as such, as a whole..." (Moretti, 2003, p. 67-68)

{:.question}
How does this concern resurface in his essay, "Conjectures on World Literature"?
**Question**: What is world literature?
**Question**: What does it aim to study?
**Question**: What does problems or concerns does it raise about national literature?
**Question**: What does he mean by the "great unread" (Moretti, 2000, 55n1)

{:.answer}
> But I actually think that it's our greatest chance, because the
sheer enormity of the task makes it clear that world literature cannot
be literature, bigger; what we are already doing, just more of it. lt has
to be different. The categories have to be different. 'lt is not the "actual"
interconnection of "things"', Max Weber wrote, 'but the conceptual
interconnection of problems which define the scope of the various
sciences. A new "science" emerges where a new problem is pursued by
a new method.'2 That's the point: world literature is not an object, it's
a problem, and a problem that asks for a new critical method: and no
one has ever found a method by just reading more texts. That's not how
theories come into being; they need a leap, a wager-a hypothesis, to
get started. (Moretti, 200, p. 55)

{:.question}
And again in the "Slaughterhouse of literature" (2000)

{:.answer}
> The history of the world is the slaughterhouse
of the world, reads a famous Hegelian aphorism; and of literature. The
majority of books disappear forever—and “majority” actually misses
the point: if we set today’s canon of nineteenth-century British novels
at two hundred titles (which is a very high figure), they would still be
only about 0.5 percent of all published novels.

# How are canons made?

**Section goal** Here we are interested in how a cannon is formed, how available media and the nature/limits of human attention drives us toward canons, and the degree to which canons are beneficial or harmful.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> In what way does the technology/medium of the book encourage the study of literature through small canons?

<span class="respond"/> How might a shift in "media" change this dynamic?

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the trade-offs that Moretti recognize? How might the desire to see details prevent the ability to see form? How might the desire to see "form" prevent the ability to see details. How do we weigh these trade-offs.

</div>

Moretti cites De Vany and Walls who point to the idea of a "cybercascade" (Moretti, 2000, Slaughterhouse, p. 210)

Still following De Vany and walls, Moretti describes the process of forming a canon as a filtering "feedback loop" (Moretti, 2000, Slaughterhouse, p. 211)

A movement from a poli-centric beginning that becomes highly centralized (p. 211)

{:.question}
Why is Form important to Moretti?

{:.answer}
Moretti is eager to find a reason that accounts for an information cascade and the formation of a canon through market filtering. He sees "form" as key: (p. 37: "...my thesis here is that what makes readers like this or that book is form")

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

If we take it that a central part of what literary scholars do is ask about **form** (what form is used, how did this form change over time), influence (who influence this author), rhetorical strategies (e.g. how does an author create a particular effect?)

<span class="respond"/> How might the confinement of data to the printed page and the close reading of a cannon distort our understanding of form? What examples can you think of?

<span class="respond"/> What other kinds of distortions
I can speak about this phenomenon from my own field and experience. The degree to which Thomas Aquinas towers over the middle ages, thoroughly distorts our view of his actual influence in the middle ages. Today people see Thomas Aquinas as somehow synonymous with medieval theology and philosophy ranging over centuries. But while Thomas Aquinas is certainly important, it is hard to see that by reading Aquinas one has clear understanding of what took place over those two centuries.

# Moretti: On Solving the Problem With Distant Reading

{:.question}
What is "distant reading"

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
Wikipedia gives us a pretty succinct answer: 

> "The term "distant reading" is generally attributed to Franco Moretti and his 2000 article, Conjectures on World Literature.[1] In the article, Moretti proposed a mode of reading which included works outside of established literary canons, which he variously termed "the great unread"[2] and, elsewhere, "the Slaughterhouse of Literature".[3] The innovation it proposed, as far as literary studies was concerned, was that the method employed samples, statistics, paratexts, and other features not often considered within the ambit of literary analysis. Moretti also established a direct opposition to the theory and methods of close reading: "One thing for sure: it cannot mean the very close reading of very few texts—secularized theology, really ('canon'!)—that has radiated from the cheerful town of New Haven over the whole field of literary studies".[4]" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading)

</div>

## Moretti's concrete experiment in "Distant Reading"

So what does Distant Reading Look like in practice? Let's look at Moretti "First Experiment" (p. 212)

{:.question}
Why does he start with detective stories? What "'specific device' of exceptional visibility do they contain? (p. 212)

{:.answer} Clues. Remember Moretti is look for "forms" in literature at scale. Clues are a visible feature of "form". Using a very visible "formal feature" he think it will be easier to assess what "distant reading" can tells about a genre's form.

By focusing on clues he develops a kind of schematic with which to organize detective stories.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Why does he think this "tree" represents a new way of approaching literature?
Consider the following quotation:

> "The branches are the result of the twists and turns of
a device, of a unit much smaller than the text. Conversely, the branches
are also part of something much larger than any text, which is the genre:
the tree of detective fiction. Devices and genres: two formal units. A very
small formal unit and a very large one: these are the forces behind this
figure—and behind literary history. Not texts. Texts are real objects—
but not objects of knowledge. If we want to explain the laws of literary
history, we must move to a formal plane that lies beyond them: below
or above; the device, or the genre." (p. 217)

Let's discuss this.

<span class="respond"/> What do you think he means when he says "we must move to a formal plane"? How has he done this by focusing on the function of clues within stories, while ignoring the stories themselves? 

<span class="respond"/> (Does this "abstraction" have similarities to the abstraction toward information; seeing the story as particular encoding of information, from which pure information can be abstracted?) [cut question?]

<span class="respond"/> How does the tree, its decision tree, its branches explain Moretti's original question? (p. 217)?

</div>

## Moretti's Second Experiment (p. 219-223)

(p. 219-223)

## In sum: Moretti's valuation of distant reading

p. 227, consider Moretti final summary of the value of "trees" as kind of "opening up.

# Other Examples of Distant Reading

There are no doubt criticisms and concerns about Moretti's approach. But I want to look at those criticism next time.

For the moment, I want to look more generally at existing techniques that are currently used in the field.

Topic Modelling
Sentiment Analysis
Source Detecting
Form analysis

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What kinds of "distortions" imposed by a small, human-sized, canon might be overcome by these kinds of methods?

<span class="respond"/> Might these kinds of methods impose new "distortions"? What examples can you think of?
</div>

# Critiques of Distant Reading 

## Ascari, The Dangers of Distant Reading: Reassessing Moretti's Approach to Literary Genres 

Let's be quick here as our goal is to not to nit pick with one approach over the other, but to generally understand the kinds of concern that can be raised. 

{.question} 
What are Ascari's main concerns with Moretti's approach? Can we boil it down to 2 or 3 issues?

<div class="answer">

Here are some of the main issues I've identified

1. [one]
1. [two]
1. [tree]

</div>

## Marche - "Big data is coming for your books" 

Marche, (https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/literature-is-not-data-against-digital-humanities/) (This would be a good one, its general and accessible. Fun to use the hypothesis to see public comments as well)

Marche makes the sharp claim that "literature is not data". 

[I wonder if this could parallel some of the discussion of Dretske from earlier, about the mysterious process of extracting semantics from information, but perhaps here it is "literature" from data.]



# "Distant Writing" ???

Finally, let's end with a provocative little foray into the future. 

If we can talk about distant reading, can we also talk about distant writing. 

What might that look like? Here are a few examples.

<div class="discussion">

<span class="respond"/> Is the possibility of "distant writing" an example of a "Latent Ambiguity"? 
Why would have never previously had to ask if writing to a communicate is a good or bad thing? 

If it is a latent ambiguity and we must now for the first time deliberate over the value of writing in many genres, when no longer compelled to write by sheer necessity, how should we evaluate this development?

<span class="respond"/> If a machine can write legal briefs, sports summaries, and entertainment reports and humans are no longer needed to write such articles, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Are there distinction to be made here? Is it good if humans no longer have to do certain kinds of writing, but bad if all human generated writing stops? What are the distinguishing characteristics?

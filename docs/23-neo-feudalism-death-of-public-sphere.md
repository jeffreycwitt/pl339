# Review: What is the Public Sphere?

**Question**: How Does Louw describe the public sphere. 

p. 93-96

**Question** Why is Dialectic Critical to the Frankfurt School and Habermas's idea of the public sphere?

Louw, p. 95: "The 'mechanism' of dialectical conflict lay at the hart of Frankfurt School thinking."

# Concerns over Commercialization in the 1980's

What is Garnham concerned about the loss of PSB (Public Service Broadcasting)

See Louw, introductary section

FCC auctions rather than licenses bandwidth. (See Lessig)

Media conglomerates own much or all of bandwidth space.

# Habermas, Commercialization and Neo-Feudalism

**Question**: Why does this Commercialization destroy the public sphere and create neo-feudalism?

In short, commercialization has interest in preventing dialectic. 

If the original bourgeosie class was the antitheis, they have no become the "thesis" and they have interest in preserving the status quo. (see p. 96)

p. 96: "Following Adorno and Horkheimer's lead, the Frankfurt School argued that the culture industry was inherently undialectical and one-dimensional, producing 'mass culture' made by an elite group of professional communicators" 

**Question**: How did/is the new ruling class modifying the communications landscape to make dialectic more difficult? 

Louw, p. 97

**Question**: Why is it not obvious that the public sphere is lost? Why does it seem like there is still is a public sphere, why does Habermas call this is a pseudo public sphere?

20th century gave rise of "professional communicators" (public relations) whose goal was to construct the idea of "public opinion" as in support of the aims of private interest, as way of generating mass support for private aims. 

> p. 94: "over time, the public sphere enmeshed with 'representivity' and managerialism, becoming merely a means to legitimate managerialists ruling elites. Habermas bemoaned the resulting 'pseudo' democracy which he said, effectively constituted a 'depoliticized public realm' (Habermass 1976:37) Hence, by the late twentieth century, although there was the appearance of political participation in Western democracies, the effects of offering voters 'pseudo' choices meant that politicians faced increasingly cynical electorates..."

see p. 97: "So mass culture results from top-down, planned communication geared towards producing 'distracting', no dialogical communication"

"The Frankfurt School, using Frudian notions, argued that mass culture was a form of reverse psychoanalysis."

See p. 98




Objection: Might the expansion of cable programming be a remedy to this, and allow for the possibility of multiple voices, and genuine dialectic?

**Question** Why does Louw suggest this is NOT what is happening? p. 99

Private interests are still controlling the diversification. It is the simulation of niche difference still controlled by monolithic private interest. p. 99 following

**Question** Where doe Louw (and Enzensberger) see real possibility for "dialectic" to re-emerge?

p. 103: "Global information capitalists will be compelled to continually expand the world's digital communication networks. The sheer size of the network makes it too large to control or to monitor or limit its uses fully. So just as the old bourgeois revolutionary 'public sphere' grew out of the Gutenberg print revolution, so too may new 'human interactivities' grow as a by-product of using the (as yet unimagined) possibilities inherent in the evolving digital networks"

(This is a great transition to next class, where will look at Shapiro and the political excitement caused by the emerging digital media.)

# Notes

Vietnam war might be good example of how government tries to control narrative of what is happening. Real details were reported by rogue reports / news outlets [i would need article here]

Another example is that movie (starring Jeremy Renner) about the San Jose reporter trying to do a story about CIA in south america and how is story was marginalized and discredited by major news outlets that were pressured by government to smother it.

These examples suggest the impact and influcence of media forms on the possibility of a genuine public sphere. Many like Habermas worry that a public sphere is no longer possibile precisely because the medium no longer allows a genuine area for a diversity of opinion where a genuine debate can occur.

# Thinking about your policy papers

As this is our final week together, I'd like to you use our class time this week to help you focus on and make progress with your final policy papers ([as described here](https://jeffreycwitt.com/pl339/docs/24-internet-as-savior.html#final-paper-assignment)). 

To that end, I would like to use our final readings as sources of guidance for how we might proceed as potential regulators or policy makers. 

First, a general tip. As you begin generating ideas, especially for rubric number 2 ("Identify a challenge that modern communications media present to the achievement of this goal") work to be as specific as possible and then let your paper grow out of this specificity. Instead of thinking of a general problem, think of very specific case or instance of this problem for which you can generate concrete detailed examples. 

The more detailed you are, the more precise you can be as a policy maker in your proposed regulation and in your argument for why this regulation would be successful. 

For example if your interested in the topic of "amplification", don't talk about amplification generally identify a particular example of amplification to focus in on. Perhaps the "retweet" button. Even before the Internet and digital technology we have "re-shared" things. For example by making copies or re-sending things by mail. How does the "retweet" button continue that but in a new way. How have costs, speed, scale change in ways that threaten values that we're protected by the old code. 

If you're interested in "information overload", don't talk about "information overload" generally, think of specific place where overload is encountered. (For example your email inbox or google search results). Then consider the effects that might result from this particular example.

We've already discussed many emerging issues, concerns, or problems, and our reading today offers us some more examples. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

We'll spend some time brainstorming in class as well, but can asynchronously brainstorm here as well? 

<span class="respond"/> What concrete cases come to mind (from today's reading, previous readings, or your own experience) where changes in communications technology are posing specific problems to deliberative democracy that could potentially benefit from regulation?

# Review: The need for regulation

> "Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in
awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war as is of every man against every
man." (Hobbes, Leviathan, Book 1, Chapter 13)

> "And because the condition of man (as hath been declared in the precedent chapter) is a condition of war of every one against every one, in which case every one is governed by his own reason,
and there is nothing he can make use of that may not be a help unto him in preserving his life
against his enemies; it followeth that in such a condition every man has a right to every thing, even
to one anotherâ€™s body. And therefore, as long as this natural right of every man to every thing
endureth, there can be no security to any man, how strong or wise soever he be, of living out the
time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live." (Hobbes, Leviathan, Book 1, Chapter 14)

In their own ways, both Sunstein and Lessig begin by challenging a common assumption that the first amendment protects speech from regulation, **absolutely**. 

Both identify this view as "incoherent" or "naive", nd though Hobbes goes unmentioned, they do so for Hobbesian reasons. Hobbes's great insight was that the pursuit of absolute freedom always leads to less freedom than would be possible if parties agreed to allow some restrictions to freedom. 

For Hobbes the war that results from pursuing absolute freedom keeps us in perpetual anxiety and risk of attack. This risk from others attempting to pursue their own freedom destroys any possibility of productive or meaningful enterprise or cultural activity. 

> "Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man,
the same consequent to the time wherein men live without other security than what their own
strength and their own invention shall furnish them withal. In such condition there is no place
for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no
navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no
instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face
of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual
fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

In the context of free speech this can be seen simply through the image of a group of people yelling at each other, each person trying to outshout the other person in order to be heard. In such a case, while in theory everyone is free to speak and shout as loud as possible, in practice no one is actually free to speak and be heard. 

As Hobbes noted, it is only when we are willing to give our hopes for the **theoretically best** option ("the right to speak at any and all times") and accept the second best option ("take turns speaking") that we are able to get the **best actually realizable option**.

In this regard, Sunstein and Lessig point out that government regulation has always been at work in order to make free speech possible. As Sunstein says: those that complain against regulation, are really just complaining about changes to the advantageous status quo that existing regulation has created. (Just a car drivers might complain that the imposition of a bike lane as undo government interference, while ignoring the fact that their entitlement to use an automobile on public streets is already the result of government "interference" &#x1F609;)

Sunstein also connects the appeal for de-regulation to an incoherent valuation of consumer sovereignty. This connection offers us one further chance to review. In this case, regulation is seen as a threat to consumer sovereignty. 

But again Sunstein sees this as incoherent. If everyone is shouting at the same time, then we really don't have any choices.

Habermas also gave us a way to think about this incoherence in an even more subtle form. 

{:.rquestion} 
As review (and example of a nice exam question) why, according to Habermas, might a singular focus on "consumer sovereignty" be self-defeating? Consider our earlier discussion in [lesson 25](https://jeffreycwitt.com/pl339/docs/25-free-speech-and-polarization.html#ideal-speech-conditions). To what extent do our "free choices" represent our "real choice" when we are confined to the bubble of self-filtered content or manipulated by powerful private interest?

{:.rquestion}
Using Sunstein as a guide, what are some of the ways the free and supposedly unregulated Internet already benefits from government regulation?

Lessig has a nice way of explaining this using the image of the four modalities of regulation. 

He notes that regulation can both be a **constraint** and a **protection** against the constraint of other forms of regulation. 

{:.rquestion}
But if government is the regulator imposing the restraint why would we ever need regulation as a protection against restraint? 

Because in the first place, as Habermas pointed out, a government can be at odds with itself insofar as the "administrative power" can be in competition with the will of the people. 

But in the second place, as Lessig is continually at pains to stress, the laws made by the government are not the only form of regulation. Powerful private interest can directly wield the three modalities of regulation (market, norms, and code) and indirectly, through lobbying efforts, affect the law as well. 

Thus in addition to thinking about regulation as a constraint, the constraint itself can be used as a form of protection against competing forms of regulation that threaten something that a society holds valuable. 

After all, if someone is wealthy enough to buy a megaphone that would allow then to shout over others, this is a form of private regulation through market and code. 

Government regulation that attempts to use code, market, norms, or law to give everyone, rich or poor, an equal opportunity to speak should strictly speaking **not** be seen as a **constraint** -- though it can often feel like one (e.g. "You are NOT allowed to use your megaphone"). On the contrary, such a government imposition is meant to be a protection of the maximal amount of freedom that all individuals can be possess in social context.

# Sunstein: Advice for cautious regulators

In making the overall argument that we should be open to the idea that society is justified in regulating speech to promote the ends of deliberative democracy, Sunstein offers us some reminders of why it is important to be cautions regulators. 

There are important reasons that society has been wary of regulation. 

{:.rquestion} 
Why for example does Sunstein note that courts have always emphasized that political speech should be especially protected, while other forms of speech (for example advertising) might be regulated in a more heavy handed way. 

Sunstein notes at least three reasons on pp. 205-206.

Thus, on the one hand, Sunstein has made an argument for the regulation of political speech, but at the same time has noted that the regulation of this speech requires the utmost care, sensitivity, and subtlety.

Pages 207-212 offer us some ideas and strategies that a regulator might use. Here I see Sunstein as contributing to the same conversation in which Lessig was partaking when he identified the four modalities of regulation (law, market, norms, and code).

Since we spent quite a bit of time discussion the YouTube algorithm and interface, and its proclivity to create polarized groups rather than deliberative enclaves (as described by Sunstein in chapter 3), let's consider these regulatory strategies in the case of YouTube, imagine what this regulation would like, and assess its pros and cons. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

The first kind "neutrality" is a regulation that is "neutral with respect to the content of speech at issue". 

<span class="respond"/> What might a regulation policy with this kind of neutrality targeted at YouTube look like? 

<span class="respond"/> For example, what about a ban on all speech one month before any election? What other examples come to mind?

<span class="respond"/> Why would such a policy be "neutral with respect to the content of speech at issue"?

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the advantages of this position? 

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the negatives?

</div> 


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

The second kind "neutrality" is a regulation that addresses speech of a particular content, but is neutral with respect to a given point of view.

<span class="respond"/> What might a regulation policy with this kind of neutrality targeted at YouTube look like? 

<span class="respond"/> For example, what about a ban on all "political" speech one month before any election?

<span class="respond"/> How has the form of neutrality changed in this example?

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the advantages of this position over the first? 

<span class="respond"/> Are there new negatives with this approach that might outweigh the positives?

</div> 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Third, speech regulation could directly target a particular point of view.

<span class="respond"/> What might a regulation policy with this kind of neutrality targeted at YouTube look like? 

<span class="respond"/> What are some of the advantages of this position over the first two? Are there certain problems caused by forms of political speech on YouTube that the first two approaches would not be able to address?

<span class="respond"/> This third form is the most direct and efficient way to regulate speech? So why not always take this approach? What are some of its disadvantages? How do we know when it should be used and when it should not?

</div> 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Finally, Sunstein discusses different ways that regulators can "incentivize".

In the above examples, I mostly spoke about "banning" which is enforced through penalties.

<span class="respond"/> Why does Sunstein see "subsidies" as preferable to penalities?

<span class="respond"/> Still trying to remain as concrete as possible, how might the government use "subsidies" to address some of the problems in the YouTube algorithm?

# Lessig: Free Speech and Regulation Through Code

In thinking about regulation, our minds turn most quickly to direct censorship and explicit punishment. Sunstein has already tried to push us to be more creative regulators by noting the power and flexibility that comes with subsidies. 

Lessig is equally a pains to help us think about how regulators could affect the code, or use market or norm pressures to indirectly affect the code, that would have a similar affect. 

In this chapter, Lessig discusses possible solutions to new problems of porn and spam in the digital age. His basic methodology is worth our attention -- in light of our final paper assignment -- because it illustrates the creative use of all four modalities of regulation to protect something valuable. 

In each case he is 1) attentive to how the "old" code constrained behavior in certain ways. Then 2) he notes how the new code removes that constraint and creates a subsequent problem. 3) Finally, he offers a creative mixed modality solution that attempts to produce "transparent" regulation which imposes the least amount of burden on others and the least amount of risk for subsequent abuse.

Let's consider each of these three aspects with each example he offers.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

With respect to pornography:

<span class="respond"/> How did the "old code" regulate, more or less sufficiently, pornography and its sale to minors?

<span class="respond"/> How did the new code create a new problem? (Be attentive here to the way different modalities affect each other. How do changes in the code change the market, which in turn changes behavior?)

<span class="respond"/> What solution does Lessig propose and how does its creatively use the modalities of regulation to come up with a sensitive regulatory solution?

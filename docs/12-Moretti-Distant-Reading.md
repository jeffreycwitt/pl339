# Review 

As we've discussed, three main categories where people have expressed an interest in the digital medium as open up new possibilities or overcoming limitations in the old medim are: 

* access immediacy (Bush, What is a Text (OHCO))
* interconnectivity (Bush Nelson)
* non linearity (Neslon) / Dynamic Presentation

Today, I want to look at a fourth category, that we might call: 

* access scale (machine assisted reading / machine action) (I'm not yet sure what the best name for this is.)

Today, we'll do this one of some writings by one pioneers of this controversial approach, Moretti, who called it "distant reading"

In our next meeting, we'll finish this up and look at some of the critiques of distant reading. 

In the following and meeting of this unit, we'll look at some more general critiques of "reading" in the new media and consider their concerns about what might be lost if traditional book reading were lost.s

# The aims of World Literature

**Question**: What is world literature?
**Question**: What does it aim to study?
**Question**: What does problems or concerns does it raise about national literature?

# Media and the Study of Literature

**Question**: In what way does the technology of the book encourage the study of literature through small canons?

**Question**: How does this encourage the study of national literature and discourage the study of world literature?

**Question**: How many a shift in "media" change this dynamic?

**Question**: What are some of the trade-offs that Moretti recognize? How might the desire to see details prevent the ability to see form? How might the desire to see "form" prevent the ability to see details. How do we weigh these trade-offs.

# Concrete examples of Distant Reading

**Question**:What kinds of research question do literary scholars ask? 

They certain ask about form (what form is used, how did this form change over time), influence (who influence this author), rhetorical strategies (e.g. how does an author create a particular effect?)

**Question**:How might the confinement of data to the printed page, and then resulting necessity of close reading distort our answers to these questions?

**Question**:How might distant reading (and machine actionable text) counteract these distorations?

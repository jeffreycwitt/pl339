# Review 

Review Layer of Abstraction and related concepts. 

# Application

(I'd like to do one application lesson here, where LoA and "information ideas" are applied to one problem in philosophy. Perhaps "epistemology"

c. 3: tries to explain how Dretske p. 50 (solves the problem of explaining reference by means of his intentional states)

If I could define the problem of "explaining reference" more clearly

I could then explain Dretske's solution, including his idea of about "digitalization" and information loss necessary for semantic extraction. 

Perhaps LoA's could be tied in by talking about how "digitalization" as a focus at particular LoA while ignoring other LoA's.

Maybe the central question is "when does information become semantic" (see p. 50)

Dretske's view: "Information is semantic if it is relevant to a goal that the receiver of the information has" (p. 50).

Thus this is "teological view"

# Quine and naturalizing of meaning (naturalising epistemology)

Quine's view seems to appose Dretske's account because it "questions the reality of intentional states" (p. 52)

# Summary 
Summary has a helpful way of trying to explain what is at issue here. 

The question is "how do we become informed" 

Information Theory might break this down into two parts. 

First, there is communication across a shannon channel. 
Second, there is the semanticisation of the information.

The second process is not actually information transfer, but an example of information loss (what Dretske calls "digitalization")

How the semanticisation happens is highly controversial. 

The goal seems to be to give "naturalized account" (maybe that is what Dretske is trying to do). but Quine seems to suggest an entirely naturalized account is not possible.

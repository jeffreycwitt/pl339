# Introduction


# Problem

One problem we face here is -- seen especially in the examples where the internet seems to advance extremism (see the podcast on youtube and radicalization) -- is to simultaneously recognize the importance of protecting freedom of speech for the benefits of preserving the possibility of discourse and debate and the same time justifying the restraint on freedom of speech in a certain cases. 

The problem is clearly illustrated for us if we follow the trajectory from Habermas to Shapiro to the rise of the alt-right. 

On the one hand, we have the Habermas like complaint about neo-feudalism aimed at the rise of media conglomerates. 

Here it seems like we need more diversity. Here it seems like freedom of speech is not be sufficiently protected. 

In this vain, we have the champions of the early internet like Shapiro welcoming the Internet as vehicle to usher in a new era of the public sphere. 

Youtube is certainly seen as such, allowing each person to be a broadcaster with the ability to say almost anything. 

This, as we have seen has bothered people to the point that there seems to be too much diversity. 

And the subsequent attempts by youtube to begin controlling content have been met by the very same "habermas" like critiques, google and the media conglomerates are trying to control speech, rather than allow the public form to exist. 

And here there is some trouble. 

How do justify the restriction of free speech without being hypocritical, without undermining the critique voiced by Habermas in the 20th century?

An approach that justifies restrictions based solely the whether one likes the outcome or not is problematic because any critique becomes circular. Speech should be free as long it says what a like to here, but it says something I don't like it should be regulated / censured because it is leading people to radicalizing. 

The circularity of this approach is evident in the fact that that left and right use the exact same rhetoric again one another, each claiming the other to be radical and of undue influence.

# Resolution 

Escaping from this circle might benefit a closer look at freedom speech and its goals, and then examining how different media types contribute to these goals, in turn justifying different forms of regulation that correspond to the unique features of each media. 

Lessig discussing a parallel topic, namely "property rights" write: 

>"But even with ordinary property--your car, or your house--property rights are never absolute. There is not property that does not have to yield at some point to the interest of the estate" (pg. 181)

>"...In countless wasy, the system of property we call "private property" is a system that balances exclusive control by individual against certain common state ends. When the latter conflict with the former, it is the former that yeilds." (p. 181)

Could something similar be said about the "right to free speech". Certainly, the first amendment would appear to raise the stakes a bit, suggesting that the value placed on the good of free speech is higher than the value of private property. But all this means is that balance is heavier in the favor of speech over the achievement of state ends than is in the case of the private properties. But it does not change the fundamental fact that the right to free speech is not absolute and thus its limits are bounded by the interest of the state, or rather the public good. 

Citizens do not have the right to scream "fire" in a crowded theater. Citizens do not have the right to scream through a bull horn through the neighborhood at 3am in the morning. 

But if the right to free speech is not absolute, there are must be values or principles that guide its demarcation, even if those values have remained implicit. 

This value as we've discussed has not always been clear or disambiguated. As we've seen in the case of Holmes and Brandeis, there is more than one value that could justify the protection of free speech. 

Holmes (consumer sovereignty) and Brandeis ( responsibility for public debate).

The reason we could consider this a latent ambiguity is because the nature of the dominant media forms of the 20th century carried with them certain features and limitations that never really forced us to decide which of these values/principles was driving the downstream effect of protecting free speech in general. 

In a world, where public broadcast was limited by the high cost of access to a limited set of bandwidths, the idea that there would be too many voices to many voices reach too many people was not a real imaginable concern.

On the contrary, all the risks were in the other direction. The constraints of media type were already doing a good job of limiting the amplification of individual opinions. The danger lie entirely in the other direction. The costs and limits of the media required us to be vigilant to protect speech of those without access to power of mass publication.

And in this the regard the desire to protect consumer choice and the desire to promote an open public discussion co-align never requiring to us to clear define which value was the principle driver.

For most of us, it seems obvious that to promote a fruitful public discussion, to allow the dynamics of dialectic to work, a diversity of opinion is required.

But it is likely much less obvious that too much diversity of opinion could harm the process of dialectic, precisely because, given the forms of media at our disposable, this was hardly conceivable. 

And it as this point the consequences of the Holmes and Brandeis positions start to have diverging effects forcing us to choose one over the other for the first time.

The power of the internet makes it possible for everyone to be a broadcaster and everyone to reach everyone. 

The argument driven my the value of consumer choices would force us to see this as a trend to be allowed with limitation. The greater the diversity of opinion the greater the power of consumer of choice, the more this value is promoted and protected.

But if the goal is is not to allow consumers to have whatever they want, but to create a space for public debate so that a refined truth might emerge through the process of dialectic, there may actually be a limit to the value of diversity both to the sheer number of opinions and to the range of those opinions.

The Brandeis position creates difficulties that the Holmes / Consumer choice opinion does force upon us. 

The boundaries set by the consumer choice position are much broader. Free speech would seem limited only by speech that in turns limits successive future free speech, or perhaps limits the equal enjoyment of the right to free speech. 

Thus on this view we could limit someone's ability to scream "fire" in a theater because this prevents the speech of the film maker, and the ability of others to watch the film. It also threatens the lives of everyone in the theater (as it likely causes a panic driven stampeded) thus threaten to reduce the amount of future consumer choice among all theater patrons. 

But the Brandeis position is more difficult as it would seem to justify more restrictions on the basis of more than just physical safety, but whether or not speech is contributing to the overall goal of creating more and more educated citizens and a more enlightened populations.

But the problem is further exacerbated by the fact that an individual's particular belief about whether or not particular speech is true or not cannot be the measure of this boundary because this leads to a circle. 

The whole point of allowing free speech from the Brandeis position is to create a kind of "agonistic" arena where beliefs can battle and the truth can emerge. To judge which opinions can and cannot enter the arena based on prior knowledge of what the truth is, is to assume the conclusion from the outset. 

The problem is that that the Brandeis (and Public Forum Doctrine) position exists on the assumption that no one individually has access to perfect knowledge, and it is only through the refinement of beliefs against the beliefs of others that we can get closer to truth. 

# Help from Virtue Epistemology

But it is perhaps here that something like Virtue Epistemology might be helpful. We might not be able to decide a priori which beliefs can enter the arena of public debate based on whether or not that specific belief conforms to a specific truth. But we maybe be able to create general classifications of beliefs that can be show to be helpful to the goals of public debate and the pursuit of truth. 

Thus without judging the specific content of any belief beforehand, we can nevertheless define beforehand parameters that determine whether such an opinion contributes to the goals of public debate or not.

In may be helpful here to imagine a trial court. The goal of such court is justice. Such a trial takes place precisely human history has observed that identify what is and what is not just is difficult, and no one individual has a God's eye perspective on the truth. The trial court presumes that none of us may ever see the truth with perfect clarity, a trial offers us the possibility of a refining discourse that may allow us to come closer. 

And of course a trial is defined, if by nothing else, than by rules determining the kinds of information that can be introduced, the kinds of witnesses that can be introduced, and the kinds of arguments can be made. Why are these rules allowed? Precisely because there is a recognition that while it is really helpful to the cause of truth to allow a diversity of few points to be considered, it doesn't follow that an unlimited range of opinion is also helpful. In fact, wild speculation and unfounded conjecture have been shown to be helpful and restricted on these grounds.

So, even while allowing a great deal more latitude in freedom of expression than is allowed in a court room, society might still be justified in limiting speech even when there is consumer demand for such speech. To avoid circular reasoning, such limitations would have to be based upon general criteria and never (or rarely) on the content of a specific claim. 

But virtue epistemology might be able to help with the development of such classifications. Patterns of excellent thinking have attributes x, y, and z, therefore claims made without these attributes or conditions could be limited. Or patterns of excellent thinking might lack attribute A, therefore claims having attribute A should not be admitted. 

Further like a courtroom, limitations might take into account scope as well as content. While it may important for a fringe opinion to be made known, if only make it clear that such a position has been taken seriously and is need of response, the resonating power of the new media has shown that allowing such a belief to echo at scale is counter productive to the reason for its origin admission. Thus limitation might similar be justified. 


# The Gettier Problem. 

Perhaps the most difficult thing about implementing such a procedure would be discipline required to resist the seductive power and scale of the media when it seems to work in one's favor. 

Does a good end justify a bad means. In the short term, it often seems so. But in the long term, the collateral damage of such a decision is a weakened public sphere and weakened ability of the public sphere to englighten the public at large.

On this point the Gettier Problem and the critiera of knowledge is helpful reminder of why the means/route to true belief is important. Simple correct belief is not sufficient. 

Therefore, virtuous knowledge, as the ideal of the public forum, would therefore justify the limitation of free expression that would in the near term appear beneficial, but ultimately long term. A short cut route to correct belief through the introduction of claims that do not meet the general criteria of inclusion would lead to correct belief but not virtuous knowledge. As such it would weaken the integrity of the public forum and produce belief states that are fragile and prone to future manipulation. 

The Gettier problem is described as follows:

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/
>"A related benefit of the basic approach is that, in the eyes of many practitioners, it solves the Gettier problem. Gettier cases follow a recipe. Start with a belief sufficiently justified to meet the justification condition for knowledge. Then add an element of bad luck that would normally prevent the justified belief from being true. Lastly add a dose of good luck that “cancels out the bad”, so the belief ends up true anyhow. It has proven difficult to explain why this “double luck” prevents knowledge (Zagzebski 1996)."

>"Here is a Gettier case (adapted from Zagzebski 1996: 285–6). Mary enters the house and looks into the living room. A familiar appearance greets her from her husband’s chair. She thinks, “My husband is sitting in the living room”, and then walks into the den. But Mary misidentified the man in the chair. It is not her husband, but his brother, whom she had no reason to believe was even in the country. However, her husband was seated along the opposite wall of the living room, out of Mary’s sight, dozing in a different chair."

>"The VE solution to the Gettier problem is that knowledge requires you to believe the truth “because of” your intellectual virtues, but Gettier subjects do not believe the truth because of their virtues, so they do not know (Zagzebski 1996: 285 ff; Greco 2003; Sosa 2007: ch. 5; Turri 2011). Some critics complain that this view is uninformative because we lack an adequate understanding of what it is to believe “because of” or “out of” virtue (e.g., Roberts & Wood 2007). Other critics argue that the basic approach still suffers from counterexamples (e.g., Baehr 2006a; Church 2013)."

The Gettier problem might show why we might criticize some media forms even if they lead to conclusion we like and address a tension (or uneasiness) in the story of Caleb (in the youtube podcast) the manner in which he seems to escape from the extremism of the right.

[references/quotes from podcast here]

For example: As Sunstein suggestion (quote on page 65), the scale of connectivity of the internet may lead marginal opinions to build because they are re-enforced by others who re-affirm these opinions and passions which "stoke" or "enflame" these opinions. 

But at first you might say, this doesn't seem necessarily bad. In fact, this kind of connectivity might seem good because the reinforcement pushes people to join the group, pursuing a cause that you see as good. 

But what happens if this same approach influence leads to radicalization toward positions we do not like. 

In this case, there appears to be little room to criticize the medium. 

The attempt to criticize it only when it leads to conclusions you don't like is problematic because it the critique is circular. The medium leads me toward a particular idea of correct belief, and then that medium is judged to good or bad based on the very belief it led me to believe.


Oddly, it seems that critiquing the medium here as the vehicle that leads to a problematic belief would force us to also the critique that led him away from it. And conversely, praising the medium that led to a better belief would force us to praise the very same medium that led him to the problematic belief. 

The VE solution to the Gettier problem might help us here. We might be able to approve of Caleb's new belief without yet calling it knowledge, because it is not yet believed on the grounds of intellectual virtue, but still on the grounds of the majority/mob or rhetorical points, or as he sometimes says "owning" an opponent in argument. In this regard, I would consider Caleb's new belief very fragile, unstable, and vulnerable to the next persuasion.

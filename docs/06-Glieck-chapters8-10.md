# Applications of Information Turn in Psychology (chapter 8)

## Reading Reflections/Questions

In chapter 8, Glieck wants to introduce us to wider impact of the emerging "informational theory", sometimes referred to as "informational theory". 

**Question**: What challenge was the relatively new field of psychology facing? 
Se p. 256-257 

**Question**: What did approach did behavioralists take? What were the limitations of this appraoch?

**Question**: How did Shannon's Maze and Rat (and Informational Theory) open up new pathways for explaining behavior?

**Reflection** it is somehow easy to see how language study has to do with communication, but how does this extend to other sciences, like psychology, or physics. 

How is the scholar of English literature involved in the study of communication? 

They see to understand how an author succeeds or fails to communicate a message. When we move from "language" to "literature" we might be think of much more complicated or subtle messages communicated through much more elaborate cues that just words and sentences. 

Nevertheless, the research could be seen as trying to detect the structures of communication. 

In psychology, this is much less clear. What does this have to do with communication? Isn't psychology about the mind? 

But if the mind's functions are really the "relay of signals" through synapsis, then are we really talking the structure of communication between synapsis and cells. 

And can't psychological disorders really just be described as "failures to communicate"? 

See p. 249-252 for description of Shannon's Maze and Mouse. How does "communication" theory explain the way the mouse "learned, remembers, and acts"? How does communication theory explain the mouse's failures as kind of "psychological neurosis? Or conversely explain "neurosis" as a kind of failure in communication of information? (See p. 250, bottom, Ralph Gerard shouts, "a neurosis!" when the mouse gets stuck in a loop.)



# Applications of Information Turn in Physics (chapter 9)

Especially Maxwell's Demon around p. 274-275

And Leo Szilard explanation of why entropy exists even in the Demon (which is why a self-perpetuating machine is still impossible), esp. top of p. 280 where Szilard explains that the Demon's informational decision requires "one bit of information" and basically offers the equivalent of Shannon's formula for Entropy. (See p. 280)


# Applications of Information Turn in Biology (chapter 9 and 10 (maybe chapter 11))


Discovery of DNA. 

Previously biologists were focused on matter and energy. 

Big breakthrough when the stopped considering this problem and focused on the question of communication. 

Made up Concrete example:

An example might be in trying to fix a disorder, let's say infertility or a birth defect. 

The older approach might have considered this a problem with matter or energy. Not enough matter to build problem, not enough energy to build properly. If we want to fix the growth, we need to give it more energy. 

This wasn't yielding strong results. 

The shift to see this a an informational problem was to see that there was an error in the encoding of the information or a lack of required information. 

The shift in therapy was not to add more matter or energy, but to supply/correct the missing information.

This therapy might a have a material component, but this is only because the information is "encoded" in some material. But the goal is to supply the matter (analogous to writing ink) in the correct way to correct the encoding. 

Good quotations for this on p. 299, top:

> "Look," he told Judson, "let me give an example. If you wen to a biologist twenty years ago and asked him, How do you make a protein, he would have said, Well, that's a horrible problem, I don't know...but the important question is where do you get the energy to make the peptide bond. Whereas the molecular biologist would have said, That's not the problem, the important problem is where do you get the instructions to assemble the sequence of amino acids, and to hell with the energy; the energy will look after itself." (p. 299)
